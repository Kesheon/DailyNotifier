[Nothing] will be able to separate us from God’s love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Everything Jehovah does is motivated by love. He lovingly cares for all our needs. Out of love, Jehovah provided the ransom arrangement for us. As for Jesus, he loves us so much that he gave his life for us. (John 3:16; 15:13) Nothing can break the bond of love that Jehovah and Jesus feel for those who are loyal to them. (John 13:1; Rom. 8:35) Likewise, everything a family head does should be motivated by love. Why is that so important? The apostle John answers: "The one who does not love his brother [or family], whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen." (1 John 4:11, 20) Specifically, a man who loves his family and who wants to imitate Jehovah and Jesus will provide for his family's spiritual, emotional, and material needs. (1 Tim. 5:8) He will train and discipline his children. He will also continue to learn to make decisions that honor Jehovah and benefit his family. w21.02
