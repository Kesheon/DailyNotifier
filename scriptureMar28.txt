The Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen you and protect you.

On the last night of his life as a man, Jesus was thinking about the challenges that his disciples would face. Moved by his love for his friends, Jesus asked his Father to "watch over them because of the wicked one." (John 17:14, 15) Jesus knew that after he returned to heaven, Satan the Devil would continue to wage war against any who wanted to serve Jehovah. Clearly, Jehovah’s people would need protection. Today we need Jehovah's protection as never before. Satan has been cast out of heaven, "having great anger." (Rev. 12:12) He has managed to convince some who persecute us that they are offering "a sacred service to God." (John 16:2) Others, who do not believe in God, persecute us because we do not fit into this world's mold. Whatever the case, we can be confident. Why? The answer is given in today's text. w21.03 26 P1, 3
