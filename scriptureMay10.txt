He will go out in a great rage to annihilate and to devote many to destruction.

This attack by the king of the north, acting along with the rest of the world's governments, provokes the Almighty and brings on the war of Armageddon. (Rev. 16:14, 16) At that time, the king of the north, along with the rest of the nations that make up Gog of Magog, comes to his end, and there will be "no helper for him." (Dan. 11:45) The very next verse in Daniel's account gives more details about how the king of the north and his allies will come to their end and how we will be saved. (Dan. 12:1) What does this verse mean? Michael is another name for our ruling King, Christ Jesus. He has been "standing in behalf" of God's people since 1914 when his Kingdom was established in the heavens. In the near future, he will "stand up," or take significant action, at the war of Armageddon. That battle will be the final event in what Daniel calls the greatest "time of distress" in history.​—Rev. 6:2; 7:14. w20.05 15-16 P15-17
