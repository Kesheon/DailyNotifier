If you, although being wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more so will the Father in heaven give holy spirit to those asking him!

God's active force is a gift we should treasure. We can deepen our appreciation for holy spirit by reflecting on what that spirit has accomplished in our day. Before Jesus ascended to heaven, he told his disciples: "You will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you, and you will be witnesses of me . . . to the most distant part of the earth." (Acts 1:8) With the backing of holy spirit, some eight and a half million worshippers of Jehovah have been gathered from every corner of the earth. Also, we enjoy a spiritual paradise because God's spirit helps us to cultivate beautiful qualities, such as love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, and self-control. These qualities make up "the fruitage of the spirit." (Gal. 5:22, 23) What a precious gift holy spirit is! w20.05 28 P10; 29 P13
