The Christ did not please himself.

Jehovah makes decisions that are in the best interests of others. For example, he decided to create life, not to benefit himself, but to share with us the joy of living. No one could have forced him to give his Son to cover our sins. He willingly decided to make that sacrifice for our benefit. Jesus too made decisions that primarily benefited others. For example, he decided to forgo his own need for rest in order to teach a crowd of people. (Mark 6:31-34) A good family head knows that one of the most difficult things he must do is make wise decisions for his family, and he takes that responsibility seriously. He tries to avoid making decisions that are arbitrary or that are based purely on emotion. Instead, he allows Jehovah to train him. (Prov. 2:6,Â 7) That way, he will think of benefiting others, not himself. (Phil. 2:4) If a husband strives to follow the example set by Jehovah and Jesus, he will be a good family head. w21.02 7 P19-21
