The word of Jehovah has been the cause of insults and jeering all day long.

The prophet Jeremiah was assigned a territory that was extremely difficult. He became so discouraged at one point that he felt like giving up. But he did not. Why not? "The word of Jehovah" was like a fire inside Jeremiah, and he could not hold it in! (Jer. 20:9) The same is true of us when we fill our mind and heart with God's Word. That is an added reason for us to study the Bible daily and meditate on it. As a result, our joy can continue to increase, and our ministry may become more productive. (Jer. 15:16) So when you feel discouraged, supplicate Jehovah for his support. He will help you to deal with your imperfections, weaknesses, or illness. He will help you to keep a balanced view of assignments of service. And he will help you to have a positive view of your ministry. Moreover, pour out your concerns to your heavenly Father. With his help, you can win the fight against discouragement. w20.12 27 P20-21
