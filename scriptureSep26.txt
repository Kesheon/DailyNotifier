If the dead are not to be raised up, "let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we are to die."

The apostle Paul may have been quoting Isaiah 22:13, which refers to the attitude of the Israelites. Instead of drawing close to God, they pursued a life of pleasure. Basically, the attitude of those Israelites was "here today, gone tomorrow," a view common even today. Clearly, the fact that Jehovah can resurrect the dead should affect our choice of associates. The brothers in Corinth needed to guard against associating with those who denied the resurrection. There is a lesson for us today: No good can come from choosing as regular associates those who have a live-for-the-moment outlook. Being with such ones can ruin a true Christian's viewpoint and habits. In fact, it might lead him to have a lifestyle that includes what God hates​—sin. Thus, Paul strongly urged: "Come to your senses in a righteous way and do not practice sin."​—1 Cor. 15:33, 34. w20.12 9 P3, 5-6
