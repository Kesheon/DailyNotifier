The Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing that he has a short period of time.

There is nothing that Satan or those influenced by him can do that will destabilize a Christian who has strengthened his own faith. (2 John 8, 9) We must expect to be hated by the world. (1 John 3:13) John reminds us that "the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one." (1 John 5:19) As this system draws to an end, Satan's anger grows hotter. He uses more than subtle forms of attack, such as the lure of immorality or the lies of apostates. He will also use brute force. Satan knows that he has only a short period of time left to try to stop our preaching work or to break our faith. It is no surprise, then, that our work is restricted or banned in a number of countries. Even so, our brothers and sisters in those lands are enduring. They are proving that no matter what the wicked one throws at us, we can be victorious! w20.07 24 P12-13
