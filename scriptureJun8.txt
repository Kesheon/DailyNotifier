The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself.

We must learn to recognize situations that could harm us and then act to avoid the danger. (Heb. 5:14) For instance, we need to choose our recreation and entertainment wisely. Television shows and movies often portray immoral conduct. Such conduct offends God and will inevitably bring about harm. Accordingly, we avoid entertainment that could gradually undermine our love for God. (Eph. 5:5, 6) We must also discern the danger of false information spread by apostates, as they try to raise doubts about our brothers and Jehovah's organization. (1 Tim. 4:1, 7; 2 Tim. 2:16) Such misinformation could undermine our faith. We must avoid being fooled by this propaganda. Why? Because these types of stories are spread "by men who are corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth." Their goal is to start "arguments and debates." (1 Tim. 6:4, 5) They want us to believe their slander and develop wicked suspicions about our brothers. w20.09 29
