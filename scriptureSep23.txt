Stop judging by the outward appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.

Would you like people to judge you based on the color of your skin, the shape of your face, or the size of your body? Likely, you would not. How comforting it is to know, then, that Jehovah does not judge us by what human eyes can see! For example, when Samuel looked at the sons of Jesse, he did not see what Jehovah saw. Jehovah had told Samuel that one of Jesse's sons would become king of Israel. But which one? When Samuel saw Jesse's oldest son, Eliab, he said: "Surely here before Jehovah stands his anointed one." Eliab looked like a king. "But Jehovah said to Samuel: 'Do not pay attention to his appearance and how tall he is, for I have rejected him.'" The lesson? Jehovah continued: "Man sees what appears to the eyes, but Jehovah sees into the heart." (1 Sam. 16:1, 6, 7) We do well to imitate Jehovah when dealing with our brothers and sisters. w20.04 14 P1; 15 P3
