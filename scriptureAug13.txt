[Jehovah] does not desire anyone to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.

Jehovah has a fixed day and hour when he will bring an end to this old system. (Matt. 24:36) He will not become impatient and act before that time. He has a longing to resurrect the dead, but he is patient. (Job 14:14,Â 15) He is waiting until the right time arrives to raise them to life. (John 5:28) We have good reasons to appreciate Jehovah's patience. Just think: Because Jehovah is patient, many people, including us, have had time "to attain to repentance." Jehovah wants as many people as possible to have the opportunity to gain everlasting life. So let us show that we appreciate his patience. How? By earnestly looking for those who are "rightly disposed for everlasting life" and helping them to love Jehovah and serve him. (Acts 13:48) Then they will benefit from Jehovah's patience, just as we have. w20.08 18 P17
