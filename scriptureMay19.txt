Make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them.

If you are the one who studied with the new disciple, how thrilling for you to witness that one's baptism! (1 Thess. 2:19, 20) Newly baptized disciples are fine "letters of recommendation," not just for those who studied with them but also for the whole congregation. (2 Cor. 3:1-3) It is very good to see that in a four year period, on average, some 10,000,000 Bible studies have been reported every month worldwide. And during those same years, on average, over 280,000 got baptized each year as Jehovah's Witnesses and new disciples of Jesus Christ. How can we help more of those millions of Bible students to get baptized? As long as Jehovah is patiently allowing people the time and opportunity to become Christ's disciples, we want to do all we can to help them progress to baptism as quickly as possible. Time is fast running out!​—1 Cor. 7:29a; 1 Pet. 4:7. w20.10 6 P1-2
