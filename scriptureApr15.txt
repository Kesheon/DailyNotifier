We will always be with the Lord.

Anointed ones who today finish their earthly course are instantly raised to life in the heavens. This is confirmed by the apostle Paul's words recorded at 1 Corinthians 15:51, 52. Upon their resurrection, these brothers of Christ will have complete joy. The Bible tells us what work those who are changed "in the blink of an eye" will do in heaven. Jesus says to them: "To the one who conquers and observes my deeds down to the end, I will give authority over the nations, and he will shepherd the people with an iron rod so that they will be broken to pieces like clay vessels, just as I have received from my Father."—Rev. 2:26, 27. w20.12 12 P14-15
