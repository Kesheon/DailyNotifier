Stop being molded by this system of things.

Millions of families today have been divided by divorce. Even families who stay in the same house may become virtual strangers. "Mom, dad, and the kids are all disconnected from each other and connected to a computer screen, tablet, smartphone, or video game console," says one family counselor. "Although these families live under the same roof, they barely know each other." We do not want to be molded by the world's loveless spirit. Instead, we need to cultivate tender affection not only for our family members but also for those who are related to us in the faith. (Rom. 12:10) What is tender affection? It is a term that specifically describes the warm friendship between close family members. That is the kind of love we should cultivate for our spiritual family, our Christian brothers and sisters. When we show tender affection, we help maintain the unity that is a vital part of true worship.​—Mic. 2:12. w21.01 20 P1-2
