He burned down the house of the true God . . . and destroyed everything of value.

When the Babylonians were finished with the land, onlookers could only say: "It is a wasteland without man and beast, and it has been handed over to the Chaldeans." (Jer. 32:43) Some 200 years after Joel's prophecy, Jehovah used Jeremiah to foretell something else about this attack. He said that a thorough search would be made for those Israelites who engaged in wicked practices​—a search that would lead to their capture. "'Here I am sending for many fishermen,' declares Jehovah, 'and they will fish for them. After that I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down on every mountain and every hill and out of the clefts of the crags. . . . I will repay the full amount due for their error and their sin.'" Neither the oceans nor the forests would be able to conceal the unrepentant Israelites from the Babylonian invaders.​—Jer. 16:16, 18. w20.04 5 P12-13
