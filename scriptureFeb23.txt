I saw . . . a great crowd . . . And they keep shouting with a loud voice, saying: "Salvation we owe to our God . . . and to the Lamb."

What lies ahead? During the great tribulation, Jehovah will save us in two amazing ways. First, he will save his loyal servants during the time when he causes the kings of the earth to destroy Babylon the Great, the empire of false religion. (Rev. 17:16-18; 18:2, 4) Then, he will save his people when he annihilates the remaining elements of Satan's world at Armageddon. (Rev. 16:14, 16) When we remain close to Jehovah, Satan can do us no lasting harm. In fact, he is the one who will suffer permanent harm. (Rom. 16:20) So put on the complete suit of armor​—and leave it on! Do not try to fight the battle on your own. Support your brothers and sisters. And follow Jehovah's direction. If you do, you can be confident that your loving heavenly Father will strengthen you and protect you.​—Isa. 41:10. w21.03 30 P16-17
