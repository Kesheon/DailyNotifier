Take courage! . . . You must also bear witness in Rome.

Jesus assured the apostle Paul that he would reach Rome. However, some Jews in Jerusalem planned to ambush Paul and kill him. When the Roman military commander Claudius Lysias learned about the plan, he came to Paul's rescue. Quickly, Claudius sent Paul​—protected by many soldiers—​to Caesarea. There, Governor Felix ordered that Paul "be kept under guard in Herod’s palace." Paul was out of the reach of the would-be murderers. (Acts 23:12-35) But Felix was succeeded as governor by Festus, who wanted "to gain favor with the Jews." He asked Paul: "Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and be judged before me there?" Paul knew that he would probably be killed in Jerusalem. He said: "I appeal to Caesar!" Festus told Paul: "To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you will go." In time, Paul would be in Rome​—far out of the reach of the Jews who were seeking to kill him.​—Acts 25:6-12. w20.11 13 P4; 14 P8-10
