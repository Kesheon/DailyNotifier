Jehovah will hear my request for favor; Jehovah will accept my prayer.

Has a friend or a family member betrayed your trust? If so, you would benefit by reviewing the account of King David's son Absalom. (2Â Sam. 15:5-14, 31; 18:6-14) With the account in mind, tell Jehovah how you are feeling about the way you have been mistreated. (Ps. 6:6-8) Next, imagine how David must have felt as all of this was happening to him. He loved Absalom and trusted Ahithophel. Yet, both of these close companions betrayed him. They hurt him deeply and even tried to kill him. David could have lost faith in his other friends, suspecting that they too had joined Absalom. He might have thought only of himself and have wanted to flee the country alone. Or he could just have given up in despair. Instead, he prayed to Jehovah for help. He also asked his friends to help him. And he acted quickly to implement the decisions he made. He continued to trust in Jehovah and to trust his friends. w21.03 15 P7-8; 17 P10-11
