Each one will carry his own load.

Some Christian families have moved to another country to seek refuge or to find employment. In such cases, their children may now be educated in the main language of their new country. The parents may also need to learn the main language in order to find employment. What if there is a local congregation or group in their mother tongue? Which congregation should the family attend? Should it be a congregation in which the main language of the country is spoken or a congregation in which the family's mother tongue is spoken? The family head must decide which congregation his family will attend. Because this is a personal matter, he must consider what is in the best interests of his family. We need to respect the decision of the family head. Whatever he decides, let us accept his decision and welcome the family as a valued part of our congregation.​—Rom. 15:7. w20.08 30 P17-18
