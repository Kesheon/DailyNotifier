[Treat] older women as mothers, . . . younger women as sisters.

Jesus gave women honor and respect. He did not follow the custom of the Pharisees, who looked down on women and who would not even speak to them in public, let alone discuss the Scriptures with them. Instead, he included women in the deep spiritual discussions that he had with his other disciples. (Luke 10:38, 39, 42) He also allowed women to accompany him on his preaching tours. (Luke 8:1-3) And Jesus gave them the privilege of announcing to the apostles that he had been raised from the dead. (John 20:16-18) The apostle Paul specifically reminded Timothy to honor women. Paul acknowledged that it was Timothy's mother and grandmother who had first taught Timothy "the holy writings." (2 Tim. 1:5; 3:14, 15) Paul specifically greeted sisters by name in his letter to the Romans. He not only noticed the work sisters did but also expressed appreciation for them as Christian ministers.​—Rom. 16:1-4, 6, 12; Phil. 4:3. w21.02 15 P5-6
