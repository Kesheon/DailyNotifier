I tell everyone there among you not to think more of himself than it is necessary to think, but to think so as to have a sound mind.

We humbly submit to Jehovah's standards, realizing that Jehovah always knows what is best for us. (Eph. 4:22-24) Humility moves us to put Jehovah's will above our own and to consider others superior to us. As a result, we enjoy good relationships with Jehovah and fellow believers. (Phil. 2:3) If we are not careful, though, we could be influenced by people in Satan's system who are proud and selfish. Apparently, this was a danger to some in the first century C.E., for the apostle Paul wrote to the Romans: "I tell everyone there among you not to think more of himself than it is necessary to think, but to think so as to have a sound mind." Paul acknowledged that we need to think something of ourselves. However, humility will help us to keep a balanced view of ourselves and will help us avoid thinking too much of ourselves. w20.07 2 P1-2
