Death, where is your victory? Death, where is your sting?

God inspired some of Jesus' disciples in the first century to write about the heavenly hope. The apostle John explained: "We are now children of God, but it has not yet been made manifest what we will be. We do know that when he is made manifest we will be like him." (1 John 3:2) So anointed Christians do not know what they will be like when they are raised to heaven with spirit bodies. However, they will see Jehovah when they receive their reward. The Bible provides some information about it. The anointed will be with Christ when he brings "to nothing all government and all authority and power." That includes "the last enemy, death." Finally, Jesus​—along with his corulers—​will subject himself and all things to Jehovah. (1 Cor. 15:24-28) What a climax that will be! w20.12 8 P2
