Jehovah detests a devious person, but His close friendship is with the upright.

How many imperfect humans today enjoy a close friendship with Jehovah? There are millions. This friendship is possible because of their faith in Jesus' ransom sacrifice. On that basis, Jehovah kindly allows us to dedicate ourselves to him and get baptized. When we take these important steps, we join the millions of dedicated, baptized Christians who are enjoying "close friendship" with the greatest Person in the universe! How can we show that we treasure God's friendship? Like Abraham and Job, who remained faithful to God for well over a hundred years, we must remain faithful​—no matter how long we have been serving Jehovah in this old system. Like Daniel, we must value our friendship with God more than life. (Dan. 6:7, 10, 16, 22) With Jehovah's help, we can endure any trials we face and thus keep our close bond with him.​—Phil. 4:13. w20.05 27 P5-6
