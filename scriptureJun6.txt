O Jehovah, your name endures forever.

Adam and Eve knew Jehovah's name, as well as vital truths about the One bearing that name. They knew him as the Creator, the One who gave them life, their lovely Paradise home, and a perfect mate. (Gen. 1:26-28; 2:18) However, would they continue to use their perfect minds to meditate on all that Jehovah had done for them? Would they keep building up their love and appreciation for the Person represented by that name? The answers became clear when God's enemy tested them. Using a serpent as his mouthpiece, Satan asked Eve a question: "Did God really say that you must not eat from every tree of the garden?"(Gen. 2:16, 17; 3:1) That question contained a subtle lie that was like hidden poison. What God had actually said was that they could eat from every tree, with one exception. (Gen. 2:9) Satan made it seem as if God were not generous. Eve may have wondered, 'Is God withholding something good?' w20.06 3-4 P8-9
