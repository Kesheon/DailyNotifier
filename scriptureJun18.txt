Go, therefore, and make disciples . . . , teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.

Jesus' instructions are clear. We must teach people the things that he commanded. However, we should not overlook an important detail. Jesus did not say: 'Teach them all the things I have commanded you.' Instead, he said: Teach them "to observe all the things I have commanded you." To apply that specific instruction when teaching a Bible student, we need to be not only teachers but also guides. (Acts 8:31) To "observe" a command means to obey it. When we study the Bible with others, we teach them what God requires of us. But we must do more. We must teach our Bible students to apply in their daily life what they learn. (John 14:15; 1 John 2:3) By example, we can show our students how they can apply basic Scriptural principles at school, at work, or during recreation. In the presence of our students, we can pray to Jehovah that the holy spirit guide them.​—John 16:13. w20.11 2-3 P3-5
