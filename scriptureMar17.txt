You will be hated by all people on account of my name, but the one who has endured to the end will be saved.

We need self-discipline if we are to endure and complete our preaching work. (Matt. 28:19, 20) We do not inherit self-discipline. On the contrary, our natural inclination often is to follow the course of least resistance. It takes self-control to be self-disciplined. Therefore, we need help to train ourselves to do the things that may be difficult for us to do. Jehovah gives us that help through his holy spirit. (Gal. 5:22, 23) The apostle Paul was self-disciplined. But he admitted that he had to "pummel" his body in order to do what was right. (1 Cor. 9:25-27) He urged others to discipline themselves and to do all things "decently and by arrangement." (1 Cor. 14:40) We must exercise self-discipline to maintain a good spiritual routine that includes a regular share in the preaching work.​—Acts 2:46. w20.09 6-7 P15-17
