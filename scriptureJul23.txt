Accept the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, that is, God's word.


The helmet of salvation is the hope Jehovah gives us​—the hope that he will save us from death and will reward all those who do his will. (1 Thess. 5:8; 1 Tim. 4:10; Titus 1:1, 2) The hope of salvation protects our thinking ability. It keeps us focused on God’s promises and helps us to see problems in the right perspective. We wear this helmet by keeping our thinking in harmony with God's thoughts. For example, we place our hope, not on uncertain riches, but on God. (Ps. 26:2; 104:34; 1 Tim. 6:17) The sword of the spirit is God's Word, the Bible. That sword has the power to cut through deception and to liberate people from being enslaved to false teachings and harmful habits. (2 Cor. 10:4, 5; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17; Heb. 4:12) We learn to use that sword properly through personal study and through the training we receive from God's organization.​—2 Tim. 2:15. w21.03 27 P4; 29 P10-11
