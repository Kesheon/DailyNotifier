They will sanctify my name.

Despite being in a world full of people who slander and blaspheme Jehovah's name, you have the opportunity to stand up and speak the truth​—that Jehovah is holy, righteous, good, and loving. You can support his rule. You can promote it as the only way of ruling that is truly righteous and that will bring peace and happiness to all creation. (Ps. 37:9, 37; 146:5, 6, 10) When we teach Bible truths to others, we often emphasize God's sovereignty, that Jehovah has the right to rule the universe, and this is perfectly true. However, while it is important to focus on God's laws, our main goal is that of helping others come to love Jehovah, our Father, and to be loyal to him. We thus need to highlight Jehovah's appealing qualities, emphasizing the kind of Person that the name Jehovah represents. (Isa. 63:7) As we teach in that way, we will help others to love Jehovah and to obey him because they want to be loyal to him. w20.06 6 P16; 7 P19
