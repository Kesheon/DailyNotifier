Do not be overly righteous, nor show yourself excessively wise. Why should you bring ruin to yourself?

If you ever feel that you need to give counsel to a friend, what points should you keep in mind? Before you approach your friend, ask yourself, 'Am I being "overly righteous"?' An overly righteous person judges others, not by Jehovah's standards, but by his own, and he is probably not very merciful. If after examining yourself you still see the need to speak to your friend, clearly identify the problem and use viewpoint questions to help your friend to recognize his mistake. Make sure that what you say is based on the Scriptures, remembering that your friend is accountable, not to you, but to Jehovah. (Rom. 14:10) Rely on the wisdom found in God's Word, and when counseling someone, imitate Jesus' compassion. (Prov. 3:5; Matt. 12:20) Why? Because Jehovah will deal with us in the same way that we deal with others.​—Jas. 2:13. w20.11 21 P13
