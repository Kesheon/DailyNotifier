David inquired of Jehovah.

During the time when David and his men were fugitives, they had left their families to go on a mission. While the men were away, an enemy force raided their homes and took their families captive. David could have concluded that with all the experience he had as a warrior, he could surely devise an effective strategy for rescuing the captives. Instead, David looked to Jehovah for guidance. David inquired of Jehovah: "Should I chase after this marauder band?" Jehovah indicated that David should do so and assured him that he would be successful. (1Â Sam. 30:7-10) What can you learn from this incident? Seek advice before you make decisions. Young ones, consult your parents. You can also get good advice by talking to experienced elders. Jehovah trusts these appointed men, and you can too. Jehovah views them as "gifts" to the congregation. (Eph. 4:8) You will benefit by imitating their faith and by listening to the wise suggestions they give. w21.03 4-5 P10-11
