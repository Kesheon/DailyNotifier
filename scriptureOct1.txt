"Who has come to know the mind of Jehovah, so that he may instruct him?" But we do have the mind of Christ.

When we get to know Jesus, we will imitate his way of thinking and acting. And the better we know and imitate his way of thinking, the closer our friendship with him will be. How can we imitate Jesus? Note just one example. Jesus thought more about helping others than about pleasing himself. (Matt. 20:28; Rom. 15:1-3) Because he had this mental attitude, he was self-sacrificing and forgiving. He did not easily become offended at what people said about him. (John 1:46, 47) And he did not freeze people in time by holding their past mistakes against them permanently. (1 Tim. 1:12-14) Jesus said: "All will know that you are my disciples​—if you have love among yourselves." (John 13:35) Why not ask yourself, "Am I following Jesus' example by doing everything in my power to maintain peace with my brothers and sisters?" w20.04 24 P11
