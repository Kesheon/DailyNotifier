Death came through a man.

When Adam sinned, he brought disaster on himself and his descendants. We still feel the tragic effects of his disobedience. How different is the outcome made possible because God raised his Son! "Resurrection of the dead also comes through a man," Jesus. "For just as in Adam all are dying," the apostle Paul reasoned, "so also in the Christ all will be made alive." (1 Cor. 15:22) What did Paul mean when he said that "in Adam all are dying"? Paul had in mind Adam's descendants, who inherited sin and imperfection from Adam and thus are in a dying condition. (Rom. 5:12) Adam is not among those who "will be made alive." Christ's ransom does not cover him, for Adam was a perfect man who willfully disobeyed God. The outcome for Adam is the same as what is ahead for those whom "the Son of man" will judge as "goats," namely, "everlasting cutting-off.”"—Matt. 25:31-33, 46; Heb. 5:9. w20.12 5 P13-14
