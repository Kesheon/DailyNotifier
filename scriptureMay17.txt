All those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted.

Satan has "great anger," and we would be fooling ourselves if we were to imagine that we could somehow avoid his wrath. (Rev. 12:12) In the near future, all of us will face tests of our integrity. Soon, the world will experience "great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world's beginning until now." (Matt. 24:21) During that time, family members may turn against us and our work may be banned. (Matt. 10:35, 36) Will we personally, like King Asa, trust in Jehovah for help and protection? (2 Chron. 14:11) Jehovah has been preparing us spiritually for what lies ahead. He is guiding "the faithful and discreet slave" to provide nourishing spiritual "food at the proper time" to help us remain steadfast in our worship. (Matt. 24:45) But we must do our part and build unshakable faith in Jehovah.​—Heb. 10:38, 39. w20.09 18 P16-18
