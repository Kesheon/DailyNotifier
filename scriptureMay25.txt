Jehovah is on my side; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?

The apostle Paul needed help. About 56 C.E., a crowd dragged him outside the temple in Jerusalem and tried to kill him. The next day, when Paul was brought before the Sanhedrin, he was almost torn apart by his enemies. (Acts 21:30-32; 22:30; 23:6-10) At that point, Paul may have wondered, 'How much longer can I endure this treatment?' What help did Paul receive? The night after Paul was arrested, "the Lord," Jesus, stood by him and said: "Take courage! For just as you have been giving a thorough witness about me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness in Rome." (Acts 23:11) What timely encouragement! Jesus commended Paul for the witness he had given in Jerusalem. And he promised that Paul would safely reach Rome, where he would give a further witness. After receiving that assurance, Paul must have felt as secure as a child nestled in his father’s arms. w20.11 12 P1, 3; 13 P4
