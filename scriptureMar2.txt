He has even put eternity in their heart.

Anointed Christians are not born with the heavenly hope. It has to be implanted in their heart by God. They think about their hope, pray about it, and are eager to receive their reward in heaven. They cannot even imagine what their spiritual body will be like. (Phil. 3:20, 21; 1 John 3:2) Even so, they long to take their place in the heavenly Kingdom. The other sheep cherish a hope that comes naturally to humans, the prospect of living forever on earth. They look forward to the day when they can help turn the entire planet into a paradise. They yearn for the day when they can build their houses, plant their gardens, and raise their children in perfect health. (Isa. 65:21-23) They look forward to exploring the earth​—its mountains, forests, and seas—​and to studying Jehovah's abundant creation. Above all, they are thrilled to know that their bond with Jehovah will grow ever stronger and closer. w21.01 18-19 P17-18
