With humility consider others superior to you.

Get to know your brothers and sisters better. Talk with them before and after meetings, work with them in the ministry, and if possible, invite them for a meal. When you do, you may learn that a sister who seems unfriendly is actually shy, a brother whom you thought to be materialistic is hospitable, or a family that often comes late to the meetings is enduring opposition. (Job 6:29) Of course, we should not become "meddlers in other people’s affairs." (1 Tim. 5:13) However, it is good to know something about our brothers and sisters and the circumstances that have shaped their personality. When you get to know the background of a fellow Christian whom you find irritating, you are more likely to feel empathy for that one. It takes effort to get to know your brothers better. Still, when you follow the Bible's counsel to open your heart wide, you imitate Jehovah, who loves "all sorts of people."​—1 Tim. 2:3, 4; 2 Cor. 6:11-13. w20.04 16-17 P10-12
