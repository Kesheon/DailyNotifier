Take up the complete suit of armor from God.

"The Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen you and protect you from the wicked one." (2 Thess. 3:3) How does Jehovah protect us? Jehovah has made available to us a suit of armor that can protect us from Satan's attacks. (Eph. 6:13-17) This spiritual armor is strong and effective! But it will protect us only if we put on each piece of the armor​—and keep it on. For instance, the belt of truth represents the truths found in God's Word, the Bible. Why must we wear this belt? Because Satan is "the father of the lie." (John 8:44) He has had thousands of years to practice his lying and has misled "the entire inhabited earth"! (Rev. 12:9) But the truths contained in the Bible protect us from being deceived. How do we wear this symbolic belt? We do so by learning the truth about Jehovah, by worshipping him "with spirit and truth," and by conducting ourselves honestly in all things.​—John 4:24; Eph. 4:25; Heb. 13:18. w21.03 26-27 P3-5
