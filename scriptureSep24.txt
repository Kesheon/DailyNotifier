Lift up your eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting.

Jesus had been traveling through fields, likely of young green barley. (John 4:3-6) This crop would be ready to be harvested in about four months' time. Jesus said something that must have sounded unusual: "Lift up your eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting." (John 4:35, 36) What did he mean? Jesus was apparently referring to a figurative harvest of people. Consider what had just happened. Although Jews usually had no dealings with Samaritans, Jesus had preached to a Samaritan woman​—and she had listened! In fact, while Jesus was speaking about fields that were "white for harvesting," a crowd of Samaritans who had heard about Jesus from the woman were on their way to learn more from him. (John 4:9, 39-42) One Bible commentary says about this account: "The eagerness of the people . . . showed that they were like grain ready for harvesting." w20.04 8 P1-2
