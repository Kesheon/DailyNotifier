Apart from me you can do nothing at all.

Only those who have a close friendship with Jesus will benefit from his ransom sacrifice. Jesus said that he would "surrender his life in behalf of his friends." (John 15:13) Faithful people who lived before Jesus came to earth will have to learn about him and come to love him. Such men and women will be resurrected, but even these righteous servants of Jehovah will need to form a friendship with Jesus in order to gain everlasting life. (John 17:3; Acts 24:15; Heb. 11:8-12, 24-26,Â 31) We have the joy of working along with Jesus in preaching and teaching the good news of the Kingdom. When Jesus was on earth, he was a teacher. And since his return to heaven, Jesus, as head of the congregation, has continued to direct the preaching and teaching work. He sees and appreciates your efforts to help as many as you can to come to know him and his Father. In fact, the only way we can accomplish this work is with the help of Jehovah and Jesus.
