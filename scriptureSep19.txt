What instructor is like [God]?

God's spirit will help you to make practical application of what you read and study in God's Word. Pray as did the psalmist: "Instruct me, O Jehovah, about your way. I will walk in your truth. Unify my heart to fear your name." (Ps. 86:11) So continue to take in the spiritual food that Jehovah provides through his Word and his organization. Of course, your goal is not just to gain knowledge. You want to impress the truth on your heart and apply it in your life. Jehovah's spirit can help you to do that. You also want to encourage your brothers and sisters. (Heb. 10:24, 25) Why? Because they are your spiritual family. Pray for God's spirit to help you to give heartfelt comments at Christian meetings and to do your very best when you have a part on the program. In these ways you show Jehovah and his Son that you love their precious "sheep." (John 21:15-17) So listen to your Grand Instructor by taking full advantage of the spiritual banquet he provides. w20.10 24-25 P15-17
