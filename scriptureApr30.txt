You will see your Grand Instructor with your own eyes.

Are you baptized? If so, you have publicly expressed your faith in Jehovah and your willingness to serve with his organization. Today, Jehovah directs his organization in a way that reflects his personality, purpose, and standards. Note three of Jehovah's attributes that are reflected in his organization. First, "God is not partial." (Acts 10:34) Love moved Jehovah to give his Son as a "ransom for all." (1 Tim. 2:6; John 3:16) Jehovah uses his people to preach the good news to all who will listen, thereby helping as many as possible to benefit from the ransom. Second, Jehovah is a God of order and peace. (1 Cor. 14:33, 40) Therefore, we should expect that his worshippers serve him as an orderly, peaceful group. Third, Jehovah is the "Grand Instructor." (Isa. 30:21) Thus, his organization focuses on teaching his inspired Word, both in the congregation and in the public ministry. w20.10 20 P1-3
