The land had no disturbance and there was no war against him.

In King Asa's day, the time of peace eventually came to an end. A huge military force​—one million strong—​came from Ethiopia. Its commander, Zerah, was confident that he and his army could defeat Judah. However, Asa trusted, not in numbers, but in his God, Jehovah. Asa prayed: "Help us, O Jehovah our God, for we are relying on you, and in your name we have come against this crowd." (2 Chron. 14:11) Although the Ethiopian army had almost double the number of soldiers, Asa acknowledged Jehovah's power and ability to act in behalf of His people. And Jehovah did not disappoint him; the Ethiopian army suffered a humiliating defeat. (2 Chron. 14:8-13) Although we do not know in detail what the future holds for us as individuals, we do know that any time of peace God's people enjoy will be temporary. In fact, Jesus foretold that in the last days, his disciples would "be hated by all the nations."—Matt. 24:9. w20.09 17-18 P14-16
