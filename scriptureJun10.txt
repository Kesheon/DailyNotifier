I was making greater progress in Judaism than many of my own age in my nation.​—Gal. 1:14.

Do not rely on your own strength or abilities when serving Jehovah. The apostle Paul was well-educated​—he was taught by one of the most respected Jewish leaders of his day, a man named Gamaliel. (Acts 5:34; 22:3) And at one point, Paul had some influence in the Jewish community. (Acts 26:4) But Paul did not rely on himself. Paul gladly gave up the things that made him powerful by the world's standards. (Phil. 3:8; ftn.) Paul paid a price for becoming a follower of Christ. He was hated by his own nation. (Acts 23:12-14) And he was beaten and imprisoned by his fellow citizens, the Romans. (Acts 16:19-24, 37) In addition, Paul became painfully aware of his own limitations. (Rom. 7:21-25) But rather than allow his opponents or his own shortcomings to cripple him, he took "pleasure in weaknesses." Why? Because it was when he was weak that he saw God's power at work in his life.​—2 Cor. 4:7; 12:10. w20.07 16 P7-8
