In the Christ all will be made alive.

The apostle Paul's letter was written to anointed Christians in Corinth, who would be resurrected to life in heaven. Those Christians were "sanctified in union with Christ Jesus, called to be holy ones." And Paul mentioned "those who have fallen asleep in death in union with Christ." (1 Cor. 1:2; 15:18; 2 Cor. 5:17) In another inspired letter, Paul wrote that those "united with [Jesus] in the likeness of his death" will "be united with him in the likeness of his resurrection." (Rom. 6:3-5) Jesus was raised as a spirit and went to heaven. So that will be the outcome for all "in union with Christ," that is, all spirit-anointed Christians. Paul wrote that Christ was raised as "the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep in death." (1 Cor. 15:20) Jesus was the first one ever to be raised from the dead as a spirit and to receive everlasting life. w20.12 5-6 P15-16
