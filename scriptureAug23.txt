Let us continue loving one another, because love is from God.

Many loyal Christians must work at secular jobs full-time so that they can support themselves and their families. Even so, these faithful publishers support God's organization in any way they can. For instance, some are able to provide disaster relief, others can work on construction projects, and everyone has the opportunity to donate funds to the worldwide work. They do these things because they love God and their fellow man. Each week, we prove that we love our brothers and sisters by attending congregation meetings and participating in them. Although we may be tired, we are present at those meetings. Although we may be nervous, we comment. And although we all have problems of our own, we encourage others before or after the meeting. (Heb. 10:24,Â 25) How grateful we are for the work done by our fellow publishers! w21.01 10 P11
