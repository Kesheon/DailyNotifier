You have conquered the wicked one.

Each time you resist temptation, it will get easier for you to do what is right. Remember, too, that this world's twisted view of sex originates with Satan. So when you refuse to compromise, you 'conquer the wicked one.' We acknowledge that Jehovah has the right to define what is sinful conduct. And we do our best not to commit a sin. But when we do sin, we confess our wrongdoing to Jehovah in prayer. (1 John 1:9) And if we commit a serious sin, we seek the help of the elders, whom Jehovah has appointed to care for us. (Jas. 5:14-16) However, we should not be consumed by feelings of guilt over past mistakes. Why not? Because our loving Father provided the ransom sacrifice of his Son so that our sins can be forgiven. When Jehovah says that he will forgive repentant sinners, he means what he says. So there is nothing to stop us from serving Jehovah with a clean conscience.​—1 John 2:1, 2, 12; 3:19, 20. w20.07 22-23 P9-10
