The scene of this world is changing.

Jehovah guides us on the road to life by means of the earthly part of his organization. No doubt, we readily follow the Bible-based direction we receive regarding doctrinal or moral matters. But how do we react when God's organization makes a change that affects other aspects of our life, such as selling the Kingdom Hall we attend? We will maintain our joy if we remember that we are working for Jehovah and that he is directing his organization. (Col. 3:23, 24) King David set a good example when donating funds to build the temple. He said: "Who am I and who are my people that we should be in a position to make voluntary offerings like this? For everything is from you, and we have given to you what comes from your own hand." (1 Chron. 29:14) When we donate funds, we too are giving to Jehovah what has come from his own hand. Even so, Jehovah appreciates the time, energy, and resources that we donate to support the work he wants done.​—2 Cor. 9:
