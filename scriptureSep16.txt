Appeal to . . . older women as mothers, to younger women as sisters, with all chasteness.

For some sisters, the meetings are their main opportunity to be with fellow worshippers. So we want to use those occasions to welcome them, speak with them, and let them see our concern for them. Like Jesus, we can make time to socialize with sisters. (Luke 10:38-42) Perhaps we can invite them over for a simple meal or for some recreation. When we do, we want to keep the conversation upbuilding. (Rom. 1:11, 12) Elders do well to keep Jesus' attitude in mind. He knew that singleness could be challenging for some, but he made it clear that neither getting married nor having children is the key to lasting happiness. (Luke 11:27, 28) Rather, permanent happiness comes from putting Jehovah's service first. (Matt. 19:12) Elders especially need to treat Christian women as their spiritual sisters and mothers. Elders do well to make time before or after meetings to talk with the sisters. w20.09 21-22 P7-9
