His invisible qualities are clearly seen . . . by the things made.

God's wisdom is clearly seen in the way he constructed our home, the earth. (Heb. 3:4) The earth is unique because it has all the right conditions to sustain human life. In some respects, the earth is like a boat floating in the vast ocean of space. But there are key differences between a man-made boat, full of people, and our earth. For example, how long would the occupants of a literal boat survive if they had to produce their own oxygen, food, and water and if they could not throw any waste products overboard? The people in that boat would soon die. In contrast, the earth supports billions of living creatures. It produces all the oxygen, food, and water we need, and we do not run out of those vital supplies. Its waste products are not ejected into space; yet, the earth remains beautiful and habitable. How is that possible? Jehovah designed the earth with the ability to recycle resources. w20.05 20 P3-4
