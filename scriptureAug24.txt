Let us not become egotistical.

Proud people find it difficult to commend others, preferring that they themselves receive praise. They are more likely to compare themselves with others and to promote a spirit of competition. Rather than training others and giving them authority, they are likely to say, "If you want something done right""—the way that pleases them—​"you have to do it yourself." A proud person is often ambitious and jealous. If we detect that we have a problem with pride, we should earnestly pray for Jehovah's help to 'make our mind over' so that this bad trait does not become deeply rooted within us. (Rom. 12:2) How thankful we are for Jehovah's example! (Ps. 18:35) We see his humility in how he deals with his servants, and we want to imitate him. In addition, we want to imitate the fine examples found in the Bible of modest people who had the privilege of walking with God. May we always give Jehovah the honor and the glory that he deserves.​—Rev. 4:11. w20.08 13 P19-20
