I heard the number of those who were sealed, 144,000.

As a reward for their faithfulness, Christ's anointed brothers become kings and priests with him in heaven. (Rev. 20:6) All those who make up the heavenly part of God's family will be eager to see the 144,000 anointed ones receive their heavenly reward. After telling about these 144,000 kings and priests, the apostle John sees something exciting, "a great crowd" who survive Armageddon. Unlike the first group, this second group is much larger and has no fixed number. (Rev. 7:9, 10) They are "dressed in white robes," indicating that they have kept themselves "without spot" from Satan’s world and have remained loyal to God and Christ. (Jas. 1:27) They cry out that they have been saved because of what Jehovah and Jesus, the Lamb of God, have done. All the while, they are holding palm branches, which shows that they joyfully acknowledge Jesus as Jehovah's appointed King.​—Compare John 12:12, 13. w21.01 15-16 P6-7
