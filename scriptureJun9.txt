[Seek], not [your] own advantage, but that of the other person.

A husband and a wife should treat each other with love and respect. (Eph. 5:33) The Bible teaches us to focus on giving rather than on receiving. (Acts 20:35) What quality will help a married couple to show love and respect? The answer is humility. Humility has helped many Christian couples find greater happiness in their marriage. For example, a husband named Steven says: "If you are a team, you will work together, especially when there are problems. Instead of thinking 'what is best for me?' you will think 'what is best for us?'" His wife, Stephanie, feels similarly. "Nobody wants to live with an opponent," she says. "When a conflict arises, we identify the problem. We then pray, do research, and talk it out. We attack the problem, not each other." Husbands and wives truly benefit when they do not think more of themselves than is necessary. w20.07 3-4 P5-6
