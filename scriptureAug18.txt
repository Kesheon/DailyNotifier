I will give you insight and instruct you in the way you should go.

Jehovah takes great pleasure in educating his people. He wants them to know him, to love him, and to live forever as his beloved children. All of this would be impossible without the education he provides. (John 17:3) Jehovah used the first-century Christian congregation to educate his people. (Col. 1:9, 10) Holy spirit​—the "helper" that Jesus had promised—​played a major role. (John 14:16) It gave the disciples more insight into God's Word, and it brought back to their mind the many things Jesus said and did, as later recorded in the Gospels. This knowledge strengthened the early Christians' faith as well as their love for God, for his Son, and for one another. Jehovah foretold that "in the final part of the days," people of all nations would flock to his figurative mountain to be instructed about his ways. (Isa. 2:2, 3) We are seeing that prophecy being fulfilled. w20.10 24 P14-15
