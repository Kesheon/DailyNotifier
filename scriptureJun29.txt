[Turn] away from the empty speeches that violate what is holy.

Some of Timothy's contemporaries failed to appreciate their privilege of being fellow workers with God. These included Demas, Phygelus, Hermogenes, Hymenaeus, Alexander, and Philetus. (1 Tim. 1:19, 20; 2 Tim. 1:15; 2:16-18; 4:10) Apparently, all these people were once spiritually strong, but they lost their sense of what was truly valuable. How does Satan try to make us give up the treasures that Jehovah has entrusted us with? Note some of Satan's tactics. He uses entertainment and the media to promote values, thinking, and behavior that he hopes will cause us to loosen our grip on the truth. He attempts to intimidate us through peer pressure or persecution so that we will stop preaching. And he tries to entice us to listen to "the falsely called 'knowledge'" of apostates so that we will abandon the truth. If we are not careful, we could gradually lose our grip on the truth.​—1 Tim. 6:21. w20.09 27 P6-8
