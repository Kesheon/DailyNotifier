Christ has been raised from the dead.

Belief in the resurrection of Jesus is central to our Christian hope. Early in the apostle Paul's discussion of the resurrection, he brought up three realities. They are (1) "Christ died for our sins." (2) He "was buried." (3) He "was raised up on the third day according to the Scriptures." (1 Cor. 15:3, 4) What do Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection mean for us? The prophet Isaiah foretold that the Messiah would be "cut off from the land of the living" and be "given a burial place with the wicked." More was involved, though. Isaiah added that the Messiah would carry "the sin of many people." Jesus did this by providing the ransom. (Isa. 53:8, 9, 12; Matt. 20:28; Rom. 5:8) So the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus provide a solid basis for our hope of being set free from sin and death and being reunited with our loved ones who have died. w20.12 2-3 P4-6; 5 P11
