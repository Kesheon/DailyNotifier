They would deliver to them for observance the decrees that had been decided on by the apostles and the elders.

In the first century, the governing body in Jerusalem worked unitedly to maintain order and peace among God's people. (Acts 2:42) For example, when the issue of circumcision came to a head about 49 C.E., the governing body, under the direction of holy spirit, considered the matter. If the congregation had remained divided over this issue, the preaching work would have been hindered. Even though they were Jewish, the apostles and older men were not influenced by Jewish tradition or by those strongly promoting it. Rather, they looked to God's Word and spirit for guidance. (Acts 15:1, 2, 5-20, 28) The result? Jehovah blessed their decision, peace and unity prevailed, and the preaching work moved ahead. (Acts 15:30, 31; 16:5) In modern times, Jehovah's organization has also worked to maintain order and peace among Jehovah's people. w20.10 22-23 P11-12
