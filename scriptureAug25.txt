Those who [marry] will have tribulation in their flesh.

Marriage is a perfect gift from God, but people are imperfect. (1 John 1:8) That is why God's Word warns married couples that they will face challenges that are described as "tribulation in their flesh." Jehovah expects Christian husbands to care for the spiritual, emotional, and material needs of their family. (1 Tim. 5:8) However, married sisters have to take time from their busy schedule each day to read God's Word and meditate on it and to turn to Jehovah in earnest prayer. This can be a challenge. Wives are busy, but it is vital that they take the time. Why? Because Jehovah wants each one of us to develop and maintain a personal relationship with him. (Acts 17:27) Understandably, a wife may have to work hard to be submissive to her imperfect husband. However, she will find it easier to fulfill the assignment Jehovah has given her if she understands and accepts the Scriptural reasons why she should be submissive. w21.02 9 P3, 6-7
