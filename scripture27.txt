Each one will carry his own load.

Even if a wife is better educated than her husband, it is his responsibility to take the lead in family worship and in other theocratic activities. (Eph. 6:4) A woman must be submissive to her husband, but she is still responsible for her own spiritual health. To that end, she must allocate some time for her own personal study and meditation. That will help her to maintain her love and respect for Jehovah and to find joy in being submissive to her husband. Wives who remain subject to their husband out of love for Jehovah will find more joy and contentment than those who reject Jehovah's headship arrangement. They set a good example for both young men and young women. And they help to create a warm atmosphere not only in the family but also in the congregation. (Titus 2:3-5) Today, women make up a large part of those who are loyally serving Jehovah.​—Ps. 68:11. w21.02 13 P21-23
