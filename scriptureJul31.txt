I was rescued from the lion's mouth.

Are you dealing with opposition from members of your family? Or do you live in a country where the work of Jehovah's people is severely restricted or even banned? If so, you might be encouraged by reading 2 Timothy 1:12-16 and 4:6-11, 17-22. The apostle Paul wrote this portion of Scripture while he was in prison. Before you read those passages, tell Jehovah about your problem and how it makes you feel. Be specific. Then ask Jehovah to help you discern principles in the accounts about Paul's trials that will help you to know how you should respond to the challenge you are facing. Jehovah had warned Paul that he would have to endure persecution for being a Christian. (Acts 21:11-13) How did Jehovah help Paul? He answered Paul's prayers and over time gave him power. Paul was assured that he would receive the reward that he had worked so hard to gain. Jehovah also moved Paul's loyal friends to give him practical help. w21.03 17-18 P14-15, 19
