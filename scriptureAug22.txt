We are God's fellow workers. You are God's field under cultivation, God's building.

Have you at some point felt discouraged because your territory seems to be unproductive or because few people are found at home? In such a situation, what can be done to maintain or increase our joy? It is important to have the right view of the ministry. What does that involve? Keep your focus on proclaiming God's name and Kingdom. Jesus made it plain that relatively few will find the path to life. (Matt. 7:13, 14) When we are in the ministry, we have the honor of working with Jehovah, Jesus, and the angels. (Matt. 28:19, 20; Rev. 14:6, 7) Jehovah draws those who are deserving. (John 6:44) So if a person does not respond well to our message this time, he may listen the next time we call. “Discouragement can be a formidable weapon used by Satan," notes a sister named Deborah. But Satan's weapons are no match for Jehovah God. w20.12 26 P18-19; 27 P21
