Do not go beyond the things that are written.

With good intentions, an elder might make rules that he hopes will protect God's sheep. However, there are significant differences between the role of an elder and the role of a family head. For instance, Jehovah has assigned the elders to act as judges, and he has given them the responsibility of removing unrepentant sinners from the congregation. (1 Cor. 5:11-13) On the other hand, Jehovah has given family heads some authority that he has not given to elders. For instance, he has authorized a family head both to make and to enforce rules for his family. (Rom. 7:2) For example, a family head has the right to decide at what time his children should arrive home at night. He also has the authority to discipline his children if they fail to obey that rule. (Eph. 6:1) Of course, a loving family head consults with his wife before making rules in the household; after all, the two of them are "one flesh."​—Matt. 19:6. w21.02 16-18 P10-13
