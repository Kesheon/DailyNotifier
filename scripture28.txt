Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you.

The apostle Paul set an outstanding example of courage and endurance. At times, he felt weak. But he was able to endure because he relied on Jehovah to give him the strength he needed. (2Â Cor. 12:8-10; Phil. 4:13) We can have that kind of strength and courage if we humbly recognize that we need Jehovah's help. (Jas. 4:10) We can be certain that the trials we face are not punishment from Jehovah. The disciple James assures us: "When under trial, let no one say: 'I am being tried by God.' For with evil things God cannot be tried, nor does he himself try anyone." (Jas. 1:13) When we are convinced of that fact, we are drawn closer to our loving heavenly Father. Jehovah "does not vary or change." (Jas. 1:17) He supported the first-century Christians through their trials, and he will help each of us today too. Earnestly ask Jehovah to help you gain wisdom, faith, and courage. He will answer your prayers. w21.02 31 P19-21
