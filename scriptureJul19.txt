Become doers of the word and not hearers only.

God's Word can act as a mirror for us. (Jas. 1:23-25) Most of us look in a mirror each morning before we leave home. That way, we can see if we need to make an adjustment before others see us. Similarly, when we read the Bible each day, we will see ways that we can adjust our thinking and our attitude. Many find it helpful to read the daily text each morning before they leave home. They allow what they read to affect their thinking. Then throughout the day, they look for ways to apply the counsel from God's Word. In addition, we must have a study routine that includes reading and thinking about God's Word each day. This may sound simple, but it is one of the most important things we can do to help us stay on the cramped road to life. In a sense, God's Word acts like an X-ray machine, enabling us to see what is inside. But we must be humble if we are to benefit from the counsel we receive from the Bible or from God's representatives. w20.11 18 P3; 20 P8
