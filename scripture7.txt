Close friendship with Jehovah belongs to those who fear him, and he makes his covenant known to them.

Consider some pre-Christian men who became friends of God. Abraham was a man who showed outstanding faith. Over 1,000 years after Abraham's death, Jehovah called him "my friend." (Isa. 41:8) So not even death can separate Jehovah from his close friends. Abraham is alive in Jehovah's memory. (Luke 20:37, 38) Another example is Job. Before an assembly of the angels in heaven, Jehovah spoke confidently about Job. Jehovah called him "an upright man of integrity, fearing God and shunning what is bad." (Job 1:6-8) And how did Jehovah feel about Daniel, who served God faithfully in a pagan land for about 80 years? Three times angels assured that aged man that he was "very precious" to God. (Dan. 9:23; 10:11, 19) We can be certain that Jehovah longs for the day when he will resurrect his beloved friends who have died.​—Job 14:15. w20.05 26-27 P3-4
