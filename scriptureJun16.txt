If you search for [Jehovah], he will let himself be found by you.

We might ask ourselves, 'Do I regularly attend congregation meetings?' When we attend the meetings provided by Jehovah's organization, we receive true spiritual refreshment along with upbuilding association. (Matt. 11:28) We might also ask ourselves, 'Do I have good personal study habits?' If you live with your family, do you set aside time every week for family worship? Or if you live alone, do you still set aside time just as if you were part of a family? Also, do you share as fully as possible in the preaching and disciple-making work? Why should we ask those questions? The Bible tells us that Jehovah examines our thoughts and what is in our hearts, so we should do the same. (1Â Chron. 28:9) If we see that we need to make some changes in our goals, attitude, or thinking, we should ask Jehovah to help us make those changes. Now is the time to prepare ourselves for the tests that lie ahead. w20.09 19 P19-20
