Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely.

Some of Jehovah's servants have felt hurt by a fellow believer. The apostle Paul recognized that at times we might have a valid "cause for complaint against" a brother or a sister. We may even have been treated unjustly. If we are not careful, we could become resentful. Bitterness may eventually cause a person to drift away from Jehovah's people. Pablo, a brother in South America, was falsely accused of wrongdoing and, as a result, lost a privilege of service in the congregation. How did he react? "I got angry," says Pablo, "and I gradually drifted away from the congregation." Or a guilty conscience may torment a person who has broken God's law in the past, making him feel unworthy of God's love. Even if he was repentant and was shown mercy, he might feel that he is no longer good enough to be one of God's people. How do you feel about brothers and sisters who face situations like those just discussed? w20.06 19 P6-7
