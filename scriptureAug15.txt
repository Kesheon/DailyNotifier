Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.

Jesus treated all women with dignity. (John 4:27) Jesus, however, had special regard for women who did the will of his Father. Significantly, he viewed them as sisters and mentioned them along with the men whom he viewed as part of his spiritual family. (Matt. 12:50) Jesus also was a true friend to them. Consider his friendship with Mary and Martha, both of whom were apparently single. (Luke 10:38-42) By his words and actions, Jesus obviously made them feel comfortable. Mary felt welcome to sit at his feet as a disciple. And Martha, disturbed because Mary was not helping, felt free to tell Jesus what was on her mind. In that informal setting, Jesus was able to help both women spiritually. And he showed his care for these women and their brother, Lazarus, by visiting with them on other occasions. (John 12:1-3) It is no wonder that when Lazarus fell seriously ill, Mary and Martha knew that they could turn to Jesus for help.​—John 11:3. w20.09 20 P3; 21 P6
