When they heard of a resurrection of the dead, some began to scoff.

Such thinking may have affected some in Corinth. (1 Cor. 15:12) Also, others may have thought of the resurrection in a figurative sense, meaning that a person was once "dead" in sin but had become "alive" as a Christian. Whatever their reason, denying the resurrection meant that their faith was in vain. If God did not resurrect Jesus, no ransom was paid and all remained in sin. So those who rejected the resurrection had no valid hope. (1 Cor. 15:13-19; Heb. 9:12, 14) The apostle Paul had firsthand knowledge that "Christ [had] been raised from the dead." That resurrection was superior to the resurrection of those who had earlier been brought back to life on earth​—only to die again. Paul said that Jesus was "the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep in death." He was the first person to be raised to life as a spirit being and the first one from mankind to ascend to heaven.​—1 Cor. 15:20; Acts 26:23; 1 Pet. 3:18, 22. w20.12 5 P11-12
