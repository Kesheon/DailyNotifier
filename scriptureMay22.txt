I must . . . declare the good news of the Kingdom of God . . . , because for this I was sent.

In the first century, the message that Jesus preached offered hope to all mankind. He commanded his followers to continue the work he started, to give a witness "to the most distant part of the earth." (Acts 1:8) Of course, they could not do this work in their own strength. They would need holy spirit​—"the helper" that Jesus had promised them. (John 14:26; Zech. 4:6) Jesus' followers received the holy spirit at Pentecost 33 C.E. With the help of that spirit, they immediately began to preach, and in a short time, thousands accepted the good news. (Acts 2:41; 4:4) When opposition arose, the disciples did not give in to fear but turned to God for help. They prayed: "Grant to your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness." They were then filled with holy spirit and kept "speaking the word of God with boldness."—Acts 4:18-20, 29, 31. w20.10 21 P4-5
