Be determined not to put a stumbling block . . . before a brother.

One way we can avoid becoming "a stumbling block" to our fellow runners is by yielding to their preferences whenever possible instead of insisting on our rights. (Rom. 14:19-21; 1 Cor. 8:9, 13) In this important way, we are not like a runner in a literal race who strives to gain the prize just for himself. Those runners think primarily about their own interests. So they may try to push their way to the front of the pack. By contrast, we are not competing against one another. (Gal. 5:26; 6:4) Our goal is to help as many as possible to cross the finish line with us and gain the prize of life. So we try to apply the inspired counsel to 'look out not only for [our] own interests, but also for the interests of others." (Phil. 2:4) In the race that we run, Jehovah has kindly offered his people a guaranteed reward for completing the race​—everlasting life either in heaven or on a paradise earth. w20.04 28 P10; 29 P12
