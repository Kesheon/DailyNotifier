I have hope toward God . . . that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.

The apostle Paul was not the first to express the hope of a resurrection. The patriarch Job did too. He was confident that God would remember him and raise him to life again. (Job 14:7-10, 12-15) "The resurrection of the dead" is part of the "foundation," or "primary doctrine," of all Christian teachings. (Heb. 6:1, 2) Paul's discussion of the resurrection is recorded in 1 Corinthians chapter 15. What he wrote must have built up first-century Christians. And that chapter can build us up and strengthen a hope that we may have long held. The resurrection of Jesus Christ is key to our hope for our dead loved ones. It was part of "the good news" that Paul declared to the Corinthians. (1 Cor. 15:1, 2) In fact, he said that if a Christian lacked belief in that resurrection, his faith would be useless.​—1 Cor. 15:17. w20.12 2 P2-4
