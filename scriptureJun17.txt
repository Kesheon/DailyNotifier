Not one of you who does not say good-bye to all his belongings can be my disciple.

Jesus illustrated the cost of becoming his disciple. He spoke about someone wanting to build a tower and about a king wanting to march into war. Jesus said that the builder must "first sit down and calculate the expense" to complete the tower and that the king must "first sit down and take counsel" to see whether his troops can accomplish what they intend to do. (Luke 14:27-32) Likewise, Jesus knew that a person who wants to become his disciple should analyze very carefully what it means to follow him. For that reason, we need to encourage prospective disciples to study with us every week. As the teacher, you need to prepare well for each Bible study session. With your student in mind, meditate in advance on how to present the information simply and clearly so that your student can easily understand and apply it.​—Neh. 8:8; Prov. 15:28a. w20.10 7 P5; 8 P7
