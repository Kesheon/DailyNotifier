I have called you friends.

Those who are anointed with holy spirit have the hope of being with Jesus forever, serving as joint heirs of God's Kingdom. They will actually be with Christ​—see him, speak with him, and spend time in his company. (John 14:2, 3) Those with the earthly hope will also receive Jesus' love and attention. Even though they will not see Jesus, their bond with him will grow ever stronger as they enjoy the life that Jehovah and Jesus make possible for them. (Isa. 9:6, 7) When we accept Jesus' invitation to become his friends, we gain many blessings. For example, we benefit from his love and support right now. We are given the opportunity to live forever. And most important, our friendship with Jesus will lead us to the finest treasure of all​—a close, personal relationship with Jesus' Father, Jehovah. What a privilege we have to be called Jesus' friends! w20.04 25 P15-16
