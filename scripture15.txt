Jehovah gave him rest.

King Asa is an excellent example of a man who acted wisely by relying completely on Jehovah. He served Jehovah not only in bad times but also during times of peace. From early on, "Asa's heart was completely devoted to Jehovah." (1 Ki. 15:14, ftn.) One way Asa demonstrated his devotion was by clearing out false worship from Judah. The Bible says that "he removed the foreign altars and the high places, smashed the sacred pillars, and cut down the sacred poles." (2 Chron. 14:3, 5) He even removed Maacah, his grandmother, from being a sort of first lady in the kingdom. Why? Because she promoted false worship of an idol. (1 Ki. 15:11-13) Asa did more than clear away false worship. He promoted pure worship, helping the kingdom of Judah return to Jehovah. Jehovah blessed Asa and the Israelites with a time of peace. For a period of ten years during Asa's rulership, "the land had no disturbance."​—2 Chron. 14:1, 4, 6. w20.09 14 P2-3
