The apostles and the elders gathered together to look into this matter.

The Watchtower of October 1, 1988, stated: "Elders will recognize that Christ, by means of the holy spirit, can direct the mind of any elder on the body of elders to provide the Bible principle needed to cope with any situation or make any important decision. (Acts 15:7-15) No one elder has the monopoly of the spirit within the body." An elder who respects his fellow elders does not always try to speak first at elders' meetings. He does not dominate the discussion, and he does not believe that his opinion is always right. Instead, he states his viewpoint humbly and modestly. He listens carefully to the comments of others. More important, he is eager to share Scriptural principles and to listen to direction from "the faithful and discreet slave." (Matt. 24:45-47) As elders discuss matters in an atmosphere of love and respect, God's holy spirit will be present, and it will guide them to reach the right decisions.​—Jas. 3:17, 18. w20.08 27 P5-6
