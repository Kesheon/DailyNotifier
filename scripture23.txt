The problem is that we do not know what we should pray for as we need to, but the spirit itself pleads for us with unuttered groanings.

As you throw your anxiety on Jehovah in prayer, be sure to include words of thanks. It is good for us to count our blessings, even when our circumstances are especially difficult. If at times you are unable to find the right words to express your intense emotions, remember that Jehovah answers prayers as simple as 'Please help!' (2 Chron. 18:31) Rely on Jehovah's wisdom, not your own. Back in the eighth century B.C.E., the people of Judah felt threatened by the Assyrians. In a desperate effort to avoid coming under the Assyrian yoke, they turned to pagan Egypt. (Isa. 30:1, 2) Jehovah warned them that their wayward course would end in disaster. (Isa. 30:7, 12, 13) Through Isaiah, Jehovah told the people how they could find real security. He said: "Your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust" in Jehovah.​—Isa. 30:15b. w21.01 3-4 P8-9
