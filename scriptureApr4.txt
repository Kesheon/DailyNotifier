Christ suffered for you, leaving a model for you to follow his steps closely.

Jesus set the perfect example of obeying Jehovah. So one important way that we obey Jehovah is by following Jesus' steps as closely as possible. (John 8:29) To keep walking in the truth, we must be convinced that Jehovah is the God of truth, that everything he tells us in his Word, the Bible, is true. And we must also be convinced that Jesus is the promised Messiah. Many today doubt that Jesus has been anointed as King of God's Kingdom. John warned that there were "many deceivers," who could mislead those who were not prepared to defend the truth about Jehovah and Jesus. (2 John 7-11) John wrote: "Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ?" (1 John 2:22) The only way we can avoid being deceived is by studying God's Word. Only if we do that will we come to know Jehovah and Jesus. (John 17:3) And only then will we be convinced that we have the truth. w20.07 21 P4-5
