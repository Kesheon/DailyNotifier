The gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.

Jehovah intended for the human family to enjoy everlasting life on the beautiful planet that he had created. But when Adam and Eve rebelled against their loving Father, sin and death cast a shadow over the earth. (Rom. 5:12) How did Jehovah respond? Immediately, he stated how he would rescue mankind. (Gen. 3:15) Jehovah purposed to provide a ransom that would make it possible for Adam and Eve's children to be freed from sin and death. He could then allow each person to choose to serve Him and to receive everlasting life. (John 3:16; 1 Cor. 15:21, 22) When Jehovah through his Son resurrects countless millions, we may assume that not all of them will come back to life at the same time. Why not? Because an explosion in the earth's population would likely cause chaos. And Jehovah never does anything in a disorganized, chaotic way. He knows that for peace to last, order must be maintained.​—1 Cor. 14:33. w20.08 14 P3; 15 P5
