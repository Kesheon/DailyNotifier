The one who looks at the clouds will not reap.

As Witnesses of Jehovah, we do not judge our success by the number of people we bring into God's organization. (Luke 8:11-15) As long as we endure in preaching the good news and teaching others, Jehovah will view us as being successful. Why? Because we are being obedient to him and his Son. (Mark 13:10; Acts 5:28,Â 29) We have this additional incentive to preach now: The end of this system is fast approaching! The time left to share in this lifesaving work is greatly reduced. Do not delay or feel that you have to wait for the perfect circumstances to take part in this vital activity. Act now to strengthen your motivation, deepen your knowledge of the Bible, build your courage, and cultivate self-discipline. Join the more than eight million fishers of men, and you will experience the joy of Jehovah. (Neh. 8:10; Luke 5:10) Be determined to have a full share in this work and to see it through to completion. w20.09 7 P18-20
