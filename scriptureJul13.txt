Do your utmost to present yourself approved to God, a workman with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright.

We need to become skillful in handling God's Word. We can learn some of these skills at our meetings. But if we are to convince others that Bible truth is truly valuable, we need to stick to a regular routine of personal Bible study. We need to use God's Word to strengthen our faith. This involves more than just reading the Bible. It requires that we meditate on what we read and do research in our publications so that we can correctly understand and apply the Scriptures. (1 Tim. 4:13-15) Then we will be able to use God's Word to teach others. Again, this involves more than just reading a Bible text. We want to help our listeners to understand the verse and how it applies to them. By sticking to a regular schedule of personal Bible study, we can improve in our ability to use God's inspired Word to teach others.​—2 Tim. 3:16, 17. w20.09 28 P12
