We found brothers and were urged to remain with them.

During his journey to Rome, the apostle Paul time and again received help that Jehovah provided by means of his fellow believers. For example, two faithful companions of Paul, Aristarchus and Luke, decided to travel with him to Rome. They willingly risked their lives to be with Paul, although it does not appear that either of them had received a personal assurance from Jesus that they would reach Rome. Only later, during the rough voyage, did they learn that their lives would be spared. When they reached the port city of Sidon, Julius permitted Paul "to go to his friends and enjoy their care." (Acts 27:1-3) And later, in the city of Puteoli, Paul and his companions "found brothers and were urged to remain with them for seven days." While the Christians in those places cared for the needs of Paul and his companions, Paul no doubt brought great joy to his hosts by sharing upbuilding experiences.​—Compare Acts 15:2, 3. w20.11 15-16 P15-
