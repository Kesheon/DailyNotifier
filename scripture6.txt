He will also enter into the land of the Decoration.

What made that land especially precious was that it was the location where true worship was practiced. Since Pentecost 33 C.E., that "land" is not a single, literal geographic location; it cannot be, for Jehovah's people are spread throughout the earth. Rather, "the land of the Decoration" today is the realm of activity of Jehovah's people that includes such things as their worship of Jehovah through meetings and the field ministry. During the last days, the king of the north has repeatedly entered into "the land of the Decoration." For example, when Nazi Germany filled the role of the king of the north, particularly during the second world war, that king entered into "the land of the Decoration" by persecuting and killing God's people. After World War II when the Soviet Union took on the role of the king of the north, that king entered into "the land of the Decoration" by persecuting God's people, exiling them. w20.05 13 P7-8
