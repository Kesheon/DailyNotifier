A family head needs to maintain the right balance. He should not become so involved in secular work to support his family that he fails to care properly for his family's spiritual and emotional needs and provide them with training. Jehovah trains and disciplines us with our best interests in mind. (Heb. 12:7-9) Like his Father, Jesus trains those under his authority in a loving manner. (John 15:14, 15) He is firm but kind. (Matt. 20:24-28) He understands that we are imperfect and prone to make mistakes. (Matt. 26:41) A family head who imitates Jehovah and Jesus makes allowances for the imperfections of family members. He does not become "bitterly angry" with his wife or children. (Col. 3:19) Instead, he applies the principle recorded at Galatians 6:1 and tries to readjust them "in a spirit of mildness," remembering that he too is imperfect. Like Jesus, he realizes that the best way to teach is by example. w21.02 6-7 P
