Put on the new personality that was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty.

Imagine the joy that those who are resurrected will feel as they strip off their old personality and live according to God's righteous standards. Those who make these changes will experience a resurrection of life. On the other hand, those who rebel against God will not be allowed to disrupt the peace of Paradise. (Isa. 65:20; John 5:28, 29) Under Kingdom rule, all of God’s people will experience the truthfulness of what Proverbs 10:22 says: "It is the blessing of Jehovah that makes one rich, and He adds no pain with it." With Jehovah's spirit at work on them, God's people will become spiritually rich, that is, they will become more and more like Christ and will grow toward perfection. (John 13:15-17; Eph. 4:23) Each day they will become stronger, better people. What a joy life will be then!​—Job 33:25. w20.08 17 P11-12
