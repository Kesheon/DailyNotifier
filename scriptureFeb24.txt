Your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust.

How might we show our trust in Jehovah? By applying the direction that Jehovah gives. The Bible contains many accounts that highlight the value of keeping calm and putting our trust in Jehovah. As you study these accounts, notice what helped God's servants to remain calm in the face of extreme opposition. For example, when the Jewish supreme court ordered the apostles to stop preaching, they were not intimidated. Instead, they boldly declared: "We must obey God as ruler rather than men." (Acts 5:29) Even after being flogged, the apostles did not panic. Why? Because they knew that Jehovah was on their side. He was pleased with them. Thus, they continued preaching the good news. (Acts 5:40-42) Likewise, when the disciple Stephen faced death, he remained so peaceful and serene that his face looked "like an angel's face." (Acts 6:12-15) Why? Because he was assured of Jehovah's approval. w21.01 4 P10-11
