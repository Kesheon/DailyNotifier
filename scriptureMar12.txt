By this all will know that you are my disciples​—if you have love among yourselves.

Each one of us should show love​—the identifying mark of true Christians. But we also need "accurate knowledge and full discernment." (Phil. 1:9) Otherwise, we could be influenced "by every wind of teaching by means of the trickery of men," including apostates. (Eph. 4:14) When many disciples in the first century C.E. stopped following Jesus, the apostle Peter expressed his firm conviction that Jesus had "sayings of everlasting life." (John 6:67, 68) Even though Peter at that time did not understand all the details of those sayings, he remained loyal because he had discerned the truth about Christ. You too can strengthen your conviction in what the Bible teaches. If you do, your faith will stand the test of time, and you will help to build strong faith in others.​—2 John 1, 2. w20.07 8 P2; 13 P18
