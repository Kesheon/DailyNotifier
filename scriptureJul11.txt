[Seek] first the Kingdom.

If we are to put the Kingdom first in our lives, we must be like Abraham, who willingly made sacrifices to please God. (Mark 10:28-30; Heb. 11:8-10) Do not expect your life to be trouble-free. Even those who devote their entire life to serving Jehovah must still deal with problems. (Jas. 1:2; 1 Pet. 5:9) Today, we have more reason than ever to focus on the future. World events clearly show that we are in the final part of the last days of this system of things. Among the many blessings we will enjoy under Kingdom rule will be that of seeing our loved ones raised from the dead. At that time, Jehovah will reward Abraham for his faith and patience by bringing him and his family back to life on earth. Will you be there to welcome them? You can be if you, like Abraham, are willing to make sacrifices for God's Kingdom, if you keep your faith despite problems, and if you learn to wait patiently on Jehovah.​—Mic. 7:7. w20.08 5-6 P13-14; 7 P17
