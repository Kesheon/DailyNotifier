The prayer of the upright is a pleasure to [Jehovah].

Close friends enjoy sharing thoughts and feelings with each other. Is that true of our friendship with Jehovah? Yes! Jehovah speaks to us through his Word, and in it he reveals to us his thoughts and feelings. We communicate with him in prayer, and we can share with him our deepest thoughts and innermost feelings. As a loving Friend, Jehovah not only listens to our prayers but also answers them. Sometimes the answer comes quickly. At other times we may have to keep praying about a matter. Still, we can be confident that the answer will come at the right time and in the best way. Of course, God's answer may be different from what we expect. For example, rather than remove a trial, he might give us the wisdom and strength "to endure it." (1 Cor. 10:13) How can we show our appreciation for this priceless gift of prayer? One way is by heeding the divine counsel to "pray constantly."​—1 Thess. 5:17. w20.05 27-28 P7-8
