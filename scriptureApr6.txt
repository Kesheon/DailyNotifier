These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation.

Millions of Christian men and women will survive into the new world. Those survivors on earth will be eyewitnesses to another victory over death​—the resurrection of billions of people who died in the past. Just imagine the joy when that victorious event occurs! (Acts 24:15) And all those who prove completely loyal to Jehovah will be victorious even over inherited death. They will be able to live forever. Every Christian now alive should be grateful for the reassuring words that Paul wrote to the Corinthians regarding the resurrection. We have every reason to show that we accept Paul's urging to be fully occupied now "in the work of the Lord." (1 Cor. 15:58) If we loyally and actively share in that work, we will put ourselves in line to experience a future filled with joy. That future will be more wonderful than anything we can imagine. It certainly will confirm that our labor has not been in vain in connection with the Lord. w20.12 13 P16-17
