Remember . . . your Grand Creator in the days of your youth, before the days of distress come and the years arrive when you will say: "I have no pleasure in them."

Young ones, decide whom you will serve. You have to prove to yourself who Jehovah is, what his purpose involves, and how his will relates to your life. (Rom. 12:2) Then you will be able to make the most important decision of your life, the decision to serve Jehovah. (Josh. 24:15) If you keep a regular schedule of Bible reading and study, your love for Jehovah will continue to grow and your faith in him will become stronger. Choose to put Jehovah's will first in your life. Satan's world promises that if you use your talents for your own benefit, you will be happy. In truth, those who focus on material goals stab themselves "all over with many pains." (1 Tim. 6:9, 10) On the other hand, if you listen to Jehovah and choose to put his will first in your life, you will be successful and "you will act wisely."—Josh. 1:8. w20.10 30-31 P17-18
