From infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.

Timothy's faith was built on facts that drew him closer to Jehovah. You too must logically reason on what you have learned about Jehovah from reading the Bible. To start with, you need to prove to yourself at least three basic truths. First, you need to be convinced that Jehovah God is the Creator of all things. (Ex. 3:14, 15; Heb. 3:4; Rev. 4:11) Second, you must prove to yourself that the Bible is God's inspired message to mankind. (2 Tim. 3:16,17) And third, you need to confirm that Jehovah has an organized group of people who are worshipping him under Christ's headship and that Jehovah's Witnesses are that group. (Isa. 43:10-12; John 14:6; Acts 15:14) This does not require that you become a walking encyclopedia of Bible knowledge. Your goal should be to use your "power of reason" to strengthen your conviction that you have the truth.—Rom. 12:1.
