Godly devotion . . . holds promise of the life now and the life that is to come.

Parents, teach your children in word and action that you love Jehovah deeply. Realize that the greatest gift that you can give them is the opportunity to love Jehovah. And one of the most valuable lessons that you can teach them is how to keep a good spiritual routine of study, prayer, meetings, and participation in the ministry. (1 Tim. 6:6) Of course, you must give your children the material things they need. (1 Tim. 5:8) But remember that it will be your children's close relationship with Jehovah, not their material possessions, that will help them to survive the end of this old system and make it into God's new world. (Ezek. 7:19) How heartwarming it is to see so many Christian parents who are making good spiritual choices for their families! Children who are raised in such families often continue with the good habits they learned, and they have no regrets!​—Prov. 10:22. w20.10 28-29 P10-11
