Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.

If we want to receive the prize of everlasting life, we must follow the Christian course, or way of life. (Acts 20:24; 1 Pet. 2:21) However, Satan and those who follow his example want us to make a different choice; they want us to "continue running with them." (1 Pet. 4:4) They ridicule the course of life we follow and claim that the path they are on is better, that it leads to freedom. But their claim is false. (2 Pet. 2:19) How important it is that we choose the right road to follow! Satan wants all of us to stop running on the cramped road that is "leading off into life" and cross over to the spacious road that most people in this world are on. That road is popular and is easier to travel. But it is "leading off into destruction." (Matt. 7:13, 14) To remain on the right road and not be sidetracked, we must trust in Jehovah and listen to him. w20.04 26 P1; 27 P5, 7
