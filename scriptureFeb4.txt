In recent years, Russia and its allies have also entered into "the land of the Decoration." (Dan. 11:41) How? In 2017, this current king of the north banned the work of Jehovah's people and threw some of our brothers and sisters into prison. He also banned our publications, including the New World Translation. Further, he confiscated our branch office in Russia as well as Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls. After these actions, in 2018 the Governing Body identified Russia and its allies as the king of the north. However, even when Jehovah's people are severely persecuted, they refuse to participate in any action to subvert or change human governments. Rather, they follow the Bible's counsel to pray for "all those who are in high positions," especially when such ones are making decisions that could affect freedom of worship. w20.05 14 P9
