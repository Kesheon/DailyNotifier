Little children, we should love, not in word or with the tongue, but in deed and truth.

To help our brothers and sisters to remain in the truth, we must show compassion. (1 John 3:10, 11, 16, 17) We need to love one another not only when things are going well but also when problems arise. For example, do you know someone who has lost a loved one in death and needs to be comforted or helped in practical ways? Or have you heard that fellow believers suffered loss from a natural disaster and need help to rebuild their Kingdom Halls or homes? We show the depth of our love and compassion for our brothers and sisters not only by what we say but, more important, by what we do. We imitate our loving heavenly Father when we show love for one another. (1 John 4:7, 8) An important way that we show love is by forgiving one another. For example, someone might hurt us but then apologize. We show love by forgiving him and putting his error behind us.​—Col. 3:13. w20.07 24 P14-15
