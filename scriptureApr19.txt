I have hope . . . that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.

Loyal Christians who do not have the hope of living in heaven with Christ also have the hope of a resurrection. The Bible says that the apostle Paul and others who go to heaven share in "the earlier resurrection from the dead." (Phil. 3:11) Does that not suggest that another resurrection would follow? That would be in harmony with what Job said about his future. (Job 14:15) "Those who belong to the Christ during his presence" will be in heaven with Jesus when he brings to nothing all governments and all authority and power. Even "the last enemy, death," will be brought to nothing. Certainly, inherited death will no more afflict those raised to heaven. (1 Cor. 15:23-26) Those with an earthly hope can derive hope from Paul's words as found in today's text. Clearly, no unrighteous person can enter into heaven, so those words point to a future resurrection on earth. w20.12 6-7 P18-19
