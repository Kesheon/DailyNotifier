All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth.

We must have a relationship with Jesus in order for our prayers to be answered. This calls for doing more than simply adding the phrase "in Jesus' name" to our prayers as a formality. We must recognize how Jehovah uses Jesus in answering our prayers. Jesus told the apostles: "Whatever you ask in my name, I will do this." (John 14:13) Although Jehovah is the one who hears and answers our prayers, he has given Jesus the authority to carry out His decisions. Thus, before God answers our prayers, he sees if we have applied the counsel Jesus gave. For example, Jesus said: "If you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; whereas if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses." (Matt. 6:14,Â 15) How important it is, then, that we treat others in the same kind way that Jehovah and Jesus treat us! w20.04 22 P6
