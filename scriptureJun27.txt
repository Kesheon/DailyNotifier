Have tender affection for one another.

The Bible contains accounts of imperfect humans who showed tender affection. Consider the example of Jonathan and David. The Bible says: "Jonathan and David became bound together in close friendship, and Jonathan began to love him as himself." (1 Sam. 18:1) David was anointed to succeed Saul as king. After that, Saul became resentful of David and tried to kill him. But Saul's son Jonathan did not join his father in this murderous campaign against David. Jonathan and David promised to remain friends and always to support each other. (1 Sam. 20:42) The tender affection between Jonathan and David is all the more remarkable when we consider some factors that could have prevented them from becoming friends. For example, Jonathan was some 30 years older than David. Jonathan could have concluded that he had nothing in common with this much younger and less experienced man. Yet, Jonathan did not view or treat David as an inferior. w21.01 21-22 P6-7
