These two kings . . . will sit at one table speaking lies to each other.

The titles "king of the north" and "king of the south" were initially given to political powers located north and south of the literal land of Israel. (Dan. 10:14) Until Pentecost 33 C.E., the literal nation of Israel was God's people. From then on, however, Jehovah made it obvious that he viewed Jesus' faithful disciples as his people. Therefore, much of the prophecy recorded in Daniel chapter 11 involves, not the literal nation of Israel, but Christ's followers. (Acts 2:1-4; Rom. 9:6-8; Gal. 6:15, 16) And the identity of the king of the north and the king of the south changed over time. Even so, several factors remained constant. First, the kings interacted with God's people in a significant way. Second, they showed by their treatment of God's people that they hated the true God, Jehovah. And third, the two kings engaged in a power struggle with each other. w20.05 3 P3-4
