Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God.

As a young man, King Asa was humble and courageous. For example, when he succeeded his father, Abijah, he launched a campaign against idolatry. He also "told Judah to search for Jehovah the God of their forefathers and to observe the Law and the commandment." (2 Chron. 14:1-7) And when Zerah the Ethiopian invaded Judah with 1,000,000 soldiers, Asa wisely turned to Jehovah for help, saying: "O Jehovah, it does not matter to you whether those you help are many or have no power. Help us, O Jehovah our God, for we are relying on you." This beautiful expression shows how much confidence Asa had in Jehovah's ability to save him and his people. Asa trusted in his heavenly Father, and "Jehovah defeated the Ethiopians." (2 Chron. 14:8-12) You would no doubt agree that facing an army of 1,000,000 soldiers was a huge challenge, and it was one that Asa met successfully. w21.03 5 P12-13
