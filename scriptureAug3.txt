I Will Become What I Choose to Become.

Jehovah makes things happen by becoming whatever is needed in order to fulfill his purpose. Jehovah can also cause his imperfect human servants to become what is needed in order to serve him and fulfill his purpose. (Isa. 64:8) In these ways, Jehovah causes his will to be carried out. Nothing can stop him from causing his purposes to be fulfilled. (Isa. 46:10, 11) We can build our appreciation for our heavenly Father by meditating on what he has done and what he has enabled us to do. For instance, when we meditate on the wonders of creation, we are filled with awe at what Jehovah has accomplished, what he has caused to come into existence. (Ps. 8:3, 4) And when we meditate on what Jehovah has caused us to become so that we can do his will, we develop deep respect for him. The name Jehovah really is awe-inspiring! It includes all that our Father is, all that he has done, and all that he will do.​—Ps. 89:7, 8. w20.06 9-10 P6-7
