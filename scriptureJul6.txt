The women proclaiming the good news are a large army.

Our sisters deserve to be commended for all they do in Jehovah's service. That service includes constructing and maintaining buildings, supporting foreign-language groups, and volunteering at Bethel facilities. They assist in disaster relief work, help to translate our publications, and serve as pioneers and missionaries. In addition, wives help their husband to carry a heavy load in the congregation and in the organization. These responsible brothers would not be able to serve so fully as "gifts in men" were it not for the support of their wife. (Eph. 4:8) Wise elders realize that sisters are "a large army" of willing workers and that they are often among the most capable preachers of the good news. In addition, elders recognize that faithful, mature sisters are effective in helping younger sisters deal with challenges. (Titus 2:3-5) Certainly, our sisters deserve to be appreciated! w20.09 23-24 P13-14
