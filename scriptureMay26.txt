We have this hope . . . , both sure and firm.

Our Kingdom hope serves "as an anchor for the soul," giving us stability despite challenging circumstances or anxious thoughts. Meditate on Jehovah's promise of a future in which negative thoughts will be gone. (Isa. 65:17) Picture yourself in the peaceful new world, where distressing situations will no longer exist. (Mic. 4:4) You will also strengthen your hope as you share it with others. Do all you can in the preaching and disciple-making work. If you do, you can "have the full assurance of the hope down to the end." (Heb. 6:11) As this system of things comes to its end, we will experience more challenges that could produce anxious thoughts. We will be able to face those challenges and remain calm, not in our own strength, but through our trust in Jehovah. Let us show by our actions that we have faith in Jehovah's promise: "Your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust."​—Isa. 30:15. w21.01 7 P17-18
