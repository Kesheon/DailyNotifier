Happy is the man who keeps on enduring trial.

When the disciple Stephen was murdered, many Christians fled from Jerusalem and "were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria," eventually as far away as Cyprus and Antioch. (Acts 7:58–8:1; 11:19) We can only imagine the hardship the disciples had to endure. Still, they eagerly preached the good news wherever they went, and congregations were established throughout the Roman Empire. (1 Pet. 1:1) But far more turbulent times lay ahead for the early Christians. For instance, about the year 50 C.E., Roman Emperor Claudius ordered all Jews to leave Rome. So Jews who had become Christians were forced to abandon their homes and relocate elsewhere. (Acts 18:1-3) About 61 C.E., the apostle Paul wrote that his fellow Christians had been publicly reproached, put in prison, and plundered. (Heb. 10:32-34) And just like other people, Christians had to endure poverty and sickness.​—Rom. 15:26; Phil. 2:25-27. w21.02 26-27 P2-4
