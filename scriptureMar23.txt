Your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust.

The apostles had direct evidence that Jehovah was with them. He had given them the power to perform miracles. (Acts 5:12-16; 6:8) That is not the case with us today. Even so, through his Word, Jehovah lovingly assures us that when we suffer for the sake of righteousness, he is pleased with us and his spirit is with us. (1Â Pet. 3:14; 4:14) So rather than dwell on how we might react to severe persecution in the future, we need to focus on what we can do now to build our confidence in Jehovah's ability to sustain and deliver us. We must trust Jesus' promise: "I will give you words and wisdom that all your opposers together will not be able to resist or dispute." We have the guarantee: "By your endurance you will preserve your lives." (Luke 21:12-19) And never forget that Jehovah keeps in his memory the smallest details about his servants who die faithful to him. With that knowledge, he will resurrect them. w21.01 4 P12
