Some men joined him and became believers.

The apostle Paul did not give up on the Athenians, even though their city was filled with idolatry, sexual immorality, and pagan philosophy; nor did he let their insults discourage him. Paul himself became a Christian, although he had been "a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent man." (1 Tim. 1:13) Just as Jesus saw the potential in Paul, so Paul saw the potential in the Athenians. And his confidence was not misplaced. (Acts 9:13-15) In the first century, people of all backgrounds became Jesus' disciples. When Paul wrote to Christians living in the Grecian city of Corinth, he said that some members of that congregation had at one time been criminals or had lived shockingly immoral lifestyles. And then he added: “That is what some of you were. But you have been washed clean." (1 Cor. 6:9-11) Would you have seen that those people had the potential to change and become disciples? w20.04 12 P15-16
