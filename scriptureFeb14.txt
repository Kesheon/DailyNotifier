Jehovah is on my side; I will not be afraid.

When you pray for courage and boldness, Jehovah will answer your prayers and never abandon you. (Acts 4:29,Â 31) He is always there to give you support. Think about how he has helped you overcome challenges and given you the strength to make changes in your lifestyle. Certainly the One who led his people through the Red Sea can help you to be a disciple of Christ. (Ex. 14:13) Maintain the same conviction as did the psalmist who said the words of today's text. Jehovah can also help new publishers to be courageous. Note the experience of a sister named Tomoyo. When she started to preach from house to house, the first householder she met shouted: "I don't want anything to do with Jehovah's Witnesses!" and slammed the door. Tomoyo courageously told her companion: "Did you hear that? I didn't have to say a word, and she recognized me as one of Jehovah's Witnesses. I'm so happy!" Tomoyo now serves as a regular pioneer. w20.09 6 P13-14
