The head of every man is the Christ; in turn, the head of a woman is the man; in turn, the head of the Christ is God.

This verse describes the way in which Jehovah has organized his universal family. Headship involves two key elements​—authority and accountability. Jehovah is "the head," or the ultimate authority, and all his children, both angelic and human, are accountable to him. (Rom. 14:10; Eph. 3:14, 15) Jehovah has given Jesus authority over the congregation, but Jesus is accountable to Jehovah for the way he treats us. (1 Cor. 15:27) Jehovah has also given a husband authority over his wife and children. How can he learn to be a good family head? He must first understand what Jehovah requires of him. He also needs to know why Jehovah established headship and, specifically, how he can imitate the example set by Jehovah and Jesus. Why is this so important? Because Jehovah has given family heads a measure of authority, and he expects them to use it well.​—Luke 12:48b. w21.02 2 P1-3
