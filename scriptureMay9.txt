Unify my heart to fear your name.

A sports team that is united is more likely to have success than one that is not. Your heart can be like that successful team if your thoughts, desires, and emotions are united in serving Jehovah. Remember, Satan would love to divide your heart. He wants your thoughts, desires, and emotions to be at odds and in conflict with Jehovah's standards. You, however, need your heart to be whole in order for you to serve Jehovah. (Matt. 22:36-38) Never let Satan divide your heart! Pray to Jehovah as did David:"Unify my heart to fear your name." Make it your aim to live up to that prayer. Each day, be determined that your decisions, from small to great, show that you hold Jehovah's holy name in profound awe. In so doing, as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, you will reflect well on that name. (Prov. 27:11) And all of us will be able to say, along with the prophet Micah: "We will walk in the name of Jehovah our God forever and ever."​—Mic. 4:5. w20.06 13 P17-18
