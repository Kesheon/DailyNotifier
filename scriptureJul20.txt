The congregations continued to be made firm in the faith and to increase in number day by day.

Although the first-century Christians were often persecuted, they also enjoyed periods of peace. How did the disciples use those opportunities? Those faithful men and women preached the good news without letup. The account in Acts says that they "walked in the fear of Jehovah." They kept on preaching the good news, and as a result, they "kept on multiplying." Jehovah obviously blessed their zealous preaching during times of peace. (Acts 9:26-31) The first-century disciples took every opportunity to spread the good news. As one example, when the apostle Paul recognized that a large door was opened to him while in Ephesus, he took advantage of the opportunity to preach and to make disciples in that city. (1 Cor. 16:8, 9) The disciples put forth great effort to declare "the good news of the word of Jehovah." (Acts 15:30-35) What resulted? Today's text tells us. w20.09 16 P6-8
