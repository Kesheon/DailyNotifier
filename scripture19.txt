Ezra had prepared his heart to consult the Law of Jehovah . . . and to teach its regulations.

If you are invited to sit in on a Bible study, it would be good if you could prepare the material that will be discussed. Dorin, a special pioneer, says: "I appreciate it when my companion prepares for the study. Then he can participate in a meaningful way." Additionally, the student will likely notice that both of you are well-prepared, and this will set a good example for him. Even if you are not able to prepare the material thoroughly, at least take some time to get the key points of the lesson in mind. Prayer is an important part of a Bible study session, so think in advance about what to say if you are asked to offer a prayer. Then your prayer will likely be more meaningful. (Ps. 141:2) Hanae, who lives in Japan, remembers the prayers offered by a sister who accompanied her Bible teacher. She says: "I felt her strong friendship with Jehovah, and I wanted to be like her. I also felt loved when she included my name in her prayers." w21.03 9-10 P7-8
