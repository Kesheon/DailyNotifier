Throw your burden on Jehovah, and he will sustain you.

Our loving heavenly Father knows how our past experiences and our negative thinking have affected us. But he also sees the good in our heart​—qualities that we may not see in ourselves. (1 John 3:19, 20) Someone who is struggling to overcome a deep-seated bad habit might have a setback and feel disappointed in himself. Of course, it is normal to feel a measure of guilt when we sin. (2 Cor. 7:10) However, we should not go to extremes and condemn ourselves, thinking: 'I'm a complete failure. How can Jehovah ever forgive me?' Such negative thinking is not based on the truth and could cause us to stop serving Jehovah. Instead, "set matters straight" with Jehovah by going to him in prayer and seeking his mercy. (Isa. 1:18) Considering your sincere repentance, he will forgive you. In addition, approach the elders. They will patiently help you to become spiritually well again.​—Jas. 5:14, 15. w20.12 23 P5-6
