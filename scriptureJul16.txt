Make disciples . . . , teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.

To help Bible students to develop the desire to share the good news with others, we might ask them such questions as these: "How has accepting the Kingdom message changed your life for the better? Do you think that others need to hear this message? What can you do to help them?" (Prov. 3:27; Matt. 9:37, 38) Keep in mind that Jesus instructed us to teach others "to observe all the things" he commanded. That certainly includes the two greatest commands​—to love God and to love neighbor—​both of which are closely connected to the preaching and disciple-making work. (Matt. 22:37-39) In fact, love is the principal motive for sharing in the preaching work. Understandably for some Bible students, the thought of sharing in the preaching work may cause fear. But we can assure such students that with Jehovah's help they will gradually be able to overcome the fear of man.​—Ps. 18:1-3
