I will remain confident.

We can learn from the experiences of those who failed to keep calm and trust in Jehovah. Studying those bad examples will help us to avoid making the same mistakes they made. For instance, early in his reign, King Asa looked to Jehovah when faced with problems. But later he failed to turn to his God for help, preferring to handle matters on his own. (2 Chron. 16:1-3, 12) On the surface, Asa's asking the Syrians for help against Israel may have appeared to be very practical. But his success was short-lived. Jehovah told him through a prophet: "Because you relied on the king of Syria and did not rely on Jehovah your God, the army of the king of Syria has escaped out of your hand." (2 Chron. 16:7) We must be careful not to feel so confident about handling matters on our own that we fail to look to Jehovah for guidance through his Word. Even when we are faced with an urgent situation, we should calmly rely on Jehovah, and he will help us to succeed. w21.01 6 P1
