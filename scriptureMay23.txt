Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and . . . he was raised up.

Why can we be certain that Jehovah brought Jesus back to life? There were many eyewitnesses who testified that Jesus had been raised. (1 Cor. 15:5-7) The first witness on the apostle Paul's list was the apostle Peter (Cephas). A group of disciples confirmed that Peter saw the resurrected Jesus. (Luke 24:33, 34) In addition, "the Twelve," the apostles, saw Jesus after he was raised. Then Christ "appeared to more than 500 brothers at one time," perhaps at the joyous event in Galilee mentioned at Matthew 28:16-20. Jesus also "appeared to James," likely Jesus' half brother, who previously had not put faith in Jesus as the Messiah. (John 7:5) After seeing the resurrected Jesus, James was convinced. Significantly, about 55 C.E. when Paul wrote this letter, many eyewitnesses of the resurrection were alive, so any doubter could consult with living, credible witnesses. w20.12 3 P5, 7-8
