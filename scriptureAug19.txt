A man of understanding acquires skillful direction.

What could cause someone to reject good counsel from a loving friend? Pride. Proud people like "to have their ears tickled." They "turn away from listening to the truth." (2 Tim. 4:3, 4) They have an inflated view of their own opinion and worth. However, the apostle Paul wrote: "If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he is deceiving himself." (Gal. 6:3) King Solomon summed up the matter well. He wrote: "Better is a poor but wise child than an old but stupid king, who no longer has enough sense to heed a warning." (Eccl. 4:13) Note the example set by the apostle Peter when he was publicly corrected by the apostle Paul. (Gal. 2:11-14) Peter could have resented what Paul said, focusing on the way he said it and where he chose to say it. But Peter was wise. He accepted the counsel and did not nurse a grudge against Paul. Instead, he later referred to Paul as a "beloved brother."​—2 Pet. 3:15. w20.11 21 P9, 11-12
