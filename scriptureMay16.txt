Concerning that day and hour nobody knows, . . . only the Father.

In some countries, people respond eagerly when they hear the good news. It is just what they have been waiting for! In other lands, people show little interest in God or the Bible. What is the common response where you live? Whatever it is, Jehovah expects us to keep right on preaching until the work is completed to his satisfaction. At Jehovah's set time, the preaching work will reach its conclusion and "the end will come." (Matt. 24:14) Jesus foretold events and conditions that would mark the last days and that could distract his followers from accomplishing the preaching work. He admonished his disciples to "keep on the watch." (Matt. 24:42) Today, we face distractions similar to those that prevented the people of Noah's day from paying attention to the warning proclaimed by Noah. (Matt. 24:37-39; 2 Pet. 2:5) Therefore, we want to stay focused on the work Jehovah has given us to do. w20.09 8 P1-2, 4
