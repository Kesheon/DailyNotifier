God has arranged each of the body members just as he pleased.

Jehovah has lovingly given each of his faithful servants a place in his congregation. Although our roles are different, we are all valuable and we all need one another. The apostle Paul emphasized that none of us can look at another servant of Jehovah and say "I do not need you." (1 Cor. 12:21) If the congregation is to function peacefully, we must value one another and work together. (Eph. 4:16) When we work together in unity, the congregation thrives and is built up in love. All elders in the congregation are appointed by Jehovah's holy spirit. Yet, each one has different gifts and abilities. (1 Cor. 12:17) Some may be newly appointed and relatively inexperienced. Others may be limited because of age and health. Yet, no elder should look at any of his fellow elders and, in effect, say "I do not need you." Instead, each elder should follow the counsel of Paul as recorded at Romans 12:10. w20.08 26 P1-2; 27 P4
