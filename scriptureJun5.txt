During that time your people will escape, everyone who is found written down in the book.

We can face the future with confidence because both Daniel and John confirm that those who serve Jehovah and Jesus will survive this unparalleled time of distress. Daniel says that the survivors will have their names "written down in the book." How do we get our names in that book? We must give clear evidence that we have faith in Jesus, the Lamb of God. (John 1:29) We need to get baptized in symbol of our dedication to God. (1Â Pet. 3:21) And we must show our support for God's Kingdom by doing what we can to help others learn about Jehovah. Now is the time to build trust in Jehovah and his organization of loyal servants. Now is the time to support God's Kingdom. If we do, we will be saved when the king of the north and the king of the south are destroyed by God's Kingdom. w20.05 16 P18-19
