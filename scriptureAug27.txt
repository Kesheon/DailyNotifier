Love one another intensely from the heart.

Jehovah sets the example for us. His love is so intense that if we are loyal to him, nothing can break that bond. (Rom. 8:38, 39) The Greek word rendered "intensely" conveys the idea of stretching outward​—even straining. At times, we may need to "stretch" and "strain" in order to have tender affection for a fellow believer. When others upset us, we need to continue “putting up with one another in love, earnestly endeavoring to maintain the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace." (Eph. 4:1-3) We will look beyond our brothers' faults and try our best to view our brothers as Jehovah does. (1 Sam. 16:7; Ps. 130:3) It is not always easy to show tender affection for our brothers and sisters, especially when we are aware of their faults. Apparently, this was a challenge for some first-century Christians, as was the case with Euodia and Syntyche. The apostle Paul urged them "to be of the same mind in the Lord."—Phil. 4:2, 3. w21.01 22-23 P10-11
