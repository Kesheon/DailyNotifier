Keep conquering the evil with the good.

The apostle Paul's enemies were vastly more powerful than he was. Often, they had him beaten and thrown into jail. Also, Paul was treated badly by people who should have been friends. Some in the Christian congregation even opposed him. (2 Cor. 12:11; Phil. 3:18) But Paul conquered all who fought against him. How? He continued preaching despite opposition. He remained loyal to his brothers and sisters even when they disappointed him. And above all, he was faithful to God to the end of his life. (2 Tim. 4:8) He overcame great odds, not because he was physically strong, but because he relied on Jehovah. Do you have to deal with insults or persecution? Your goal is to embed God's Word in receptive minds and hearts. You can achieve that goal by relying on the Bible to answer people's questions, by being respectful and kind to those who treat you badly, and by doing good to all, even your enemies.​—Matt. 5:44; 1 Pet. 3:15-17. w20.07 17-18 P14-15
