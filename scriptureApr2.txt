View the fields, that they are white for harvesting.

Do you view the people to whom you preach as being like grain that is ripe for harvesting? If so, three things will prove true. First, you will preach with more urgency. A harvest period is limited; there is no time to waste. Second, you will be happy as you see people respond to the good news. The Bible says: "People rejoice in the harvesttime." (Isa. 9:3) And third, you will see each person as a potential disciple, so you will adapt your approach to appeal to his or her interests. Jesus did not write off the Samaritans, as his followers may have done. Instead, he saw them as potential disciples. We too need to see the people in our territory as potential disciples of Christ. The apostle Paul set an outstanding example for us to follow. He knew something about the beliefs of those to whom he preached, discerned their interests, and saw them as potential disciples of Jesus. w20.04 8-9 P3-4
