We have never stopped praying for you.

When preparing for a Bible study, pray to Jehovah about the student and his needs. Ask Jehovah to help you teach from the Bible in a way that will reach the person's heart. Keep in mind that your goal is to help him progress to baptism. The student also needs to communicate with Jehovah. How? By listening to and talking to Jehovah. He can listen to God by reading the Bible daily. (Josh. 1:8; Ps. 1:1-3) He can talk to Jehovah by praying each day. So offer heartfelt prayers at the beginning and at the end of each study session, praying with and for your student. As he listens to your prayers, he will learn how to pray from his heart and sincerely address his prayers to Jehovah God in the name of Jesus Christ. (Matt. 6:9; John 15:16) Imagine how reading the Bible daily (listening to Jehovah) and praying (talking to Jehovah) will help your student draw ever closer to God!​—Jas. 4:8. w20.10 8 P8; 9 P10-11
