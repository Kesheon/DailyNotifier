This kingdom . . . will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms.

The prophet Daniel describes a series of human governments that have had an impact on God's people. They are described as the various parts of a giant metal image. The last human government in that series is depicted as the feet of the image that are made of iron mixed with clay. The feet represent the Anglo-American World Power. That prophecy indicates that it will still be functioning when God's Kingdom strikes and destroys human governments. The apostle John also describes a series of world powers that have had an effect on Jehovah's people. John depicts these governments as being like a seven-headed wild beast. The seventh head of that beast represents the Anglo-American World Power. This is significant because the beast is not shown as growing any other heads. The seventh head of this beast is still dominant when Christ and his heavenly forces destroy it along with the rest of the beast.​—Rev. 13:1, 2;
