Maintain the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace.

The desire for order and peace that marked the early Christians is evident in Jehovah's organization today. (Acts 16:4, 5) To illustrate: If you were to attend a Watchtower Study in another congregation​—even in another land—​you would know how the study would be conducted and which article would be considered. Immediately, you would feel at home! What else but God's spirit can account for this precious unity? (Zeph. 3:9, ftn.) What can you do? Ask yourself: 'Do I promote unity and peace in the congregation? Am I obedient to those taking the lead? Can others depend on me, especially if I have responsibilities in the congregation? Am I punctual, helpful, and eager to serve?' (Jas. 3:17) If you see room for improvement, pray for holy spirit. The more you allow it to mold your personality and influence your actions, the more your brothers and sisters will love you and value you. w20.10 23 P12-13
