"Not by a military force, nor by power, but by my spirit," says Jehovah of armies.

Jesus' disciples faced challenges. For example, copies of the Scriptures were few. There were no study aids such as we have today. And the disciples had to preach to people who spoke many different languages. In spite of all those challenges, those zealous disciples did the seemingly impossible​—within just a few decades, they had preached the good news "in all creation under heaven." (Col. 1:6, 23) In modern times, Jehovah continues to direct and empower his people. The direction, of course, comes largely through God's spirit-inspired Word. There we find a record of Jesus' ministry and his command that his followers continue the work he started. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Jehovah is impartial; he foretold that the good news would be declared "to every nation and tribe and tongue and people." (Rev. 14:6, 7) He wants the Kingdom message to be available to all. w20.10 21 P6-8
