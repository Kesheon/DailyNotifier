Close friendship with Jehovah belongs to those who fear him.

David proved to be responsible and reliable. For example, as a young man, he diligently looked after his father's sheep. That turned out to be a dangerous assignment. David later explained to King Saul: "Your servant became a shepherd of his father's flock, and a lion came, also a bear, and each carried off a sheep from the flock. I went out after it and struck it down and rescued it from its mouth." (1 Sam. 17:34, 35) David felt responsible for the welfare of the sheep. Young brothers can imitate David by diligently fulfilling any assignment they are given. Young David developed a close, personal relationship with Jehovah. That relationship was more important than David's courage or his skill with a stringed instrument. Jehovah was not only David's God but also his Friend​—his close Friend. Young brothers, the most important thing that you can do is to strengthen your relationship with your heavenly Father. w21.03 3 P4-5
