There is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.

Will each resurrected person receive individual instruction, similar to the way we conduct Bible studies today? Will these new ones be assigned to congregations and be trained to teach those who are resurrected after them? We will have to wait and see. We do know, however, that by the end of Christ's Thousand Year Reign, "the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah." (Isa. 11:9) What a busy but enjoyable thousand years that will be! During the Thousand Year Rule of Christ, all of Jehovah's earthly children will have to make changes to please him. So all of them will have true fellow feeling as they help the resurrected ones to combat sinful tendencies and to live by Jehovah's standards. (1 Pet. 3:8) No doubt those who come back to life will be drawn to Jehovah's humble people, who will also be "working out [their] own salvation."​—Phil. 2:12. w20.08 16 P6-7
