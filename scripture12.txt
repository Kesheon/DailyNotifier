You will be hated by all the nations on account of my name.

Jehovah created us to love and to be loved. So when someone hates us, we feel hurt and perhaps even afraid. A brother writes: "When soldiers hit me, insulted me, and threatened me because I was one of Jehovah's Witnesses, I felt frightened and humiliated." Such hatred hurts, but it does not surprise us. Jesus foretold that we would be hated. Why does the world hate Jesus' followers? Because like Jesus, we are "no part of the world." (John 15:17-19) As a result, while we respect human governments, we refuse to worship them or the emblems that represent them. We give Jehovah our exclusive devotion. We uphold God's right to rule mankind​—a right that Satan and his "offspring" vigorously challenge. (Gen. 3:1-5, 15) We preach that God's Kingdom is mankind's only hope and that the Kingdom will soon crush all those who oppose it. (Dan. 2:44; Rev. 19:19-21) That message is good news to the meek but bad news to the wicked. w21.03
