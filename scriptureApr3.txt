The Grave and the place of destruction are in full view of Jehovah. How much more so the hearts of men!

Rather than judge another person's actions, do your best to understand how he feels. The only person who fully understands us is Jehovah. So ask him to help you to see in others what he sees and to understand how to show compassion for them. You cannot pick which brothers and sisters deserve your tender compassion. All of them face problems, many of which are similar to those that were experienced by Jonah, Elijah, Hagar, and Lot. In a number of cases, they have brought the problems on themselves. Realistically, all of us have done that at some point. It is reasonable, then, for Jehovah to ask us to show fellow feeling for one another. (1Â Pet. 3:8) When we obey Jehovah, we add to the unity of our remarkable and diverse global family. So when dealing with one another, may we be determined to listen, learn, and show compassion. w20.04 18-19 P15-17
