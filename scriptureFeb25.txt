They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

This signifies that they have a clean conscience and a righteous standing before Jehovah. (Isa. 1:18) They are dedicated, baptized Christians, who exercise strong faith in Jesus' sacrifice and who have a relationship with Jehovah. (John 3:36; 1 Pet. 3:21) Thus, they qualify to stand before God's throne to render him "sacred service day and night" in the earthly courtyard of his spiritual temple. (Rev. 7:15) Even now, they zealously perform the greater part of the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work, putting the interests of God's Kingdom ahead of their own. (Matt. 6:33; 24:14; 28:19, 20) The great crowd who come out of the great tribulation are assured of God's continued care, for "the One seated on the throne will spread his tent over them." The promise that the other sheep have longed to see fulfilled will be fully realized: "[God] will wipe out every tear from their eyes."—Rev. 21:3, 4. w21.01 16 P9-10
