Joseph was taken down to Egypt.

Joseph was taken down to Egypt.​—Gen. 39:1.While a slave and later in prison, Joseph had limited options and freedom of movement. How did he keep his balance? Instead of focusing on what he was no longer able to do, he diligently applied himself to the work he was assigned to do. Joseph kept Jehovah as the most important Person in his life. In turn, Jehovah blessed everything Joseph did. (Gen. 39:21-23) We are reminded that this world is cruel and that people will treat us unjustly. Even a fellow believer may hurt us. But if we view Jehovah as our Rock, or Refuge, we will not lose heart or stop serving him. (Ps. 62:6, 7; 1 Pet. 5:10) Recall, too, that Joseph may have been about 17 when Jehovah dealt with him in a special way. Obviously, Jehovah has confidence in young servants of his. Today, many young ones are like Joseph. They too have faith in Jehovah. Some of them have even been unjustly imprisoned because they would not compromise their loyalty to God.​—Ps. 110:3. w20.12 16 P3; 17 P5, 7
