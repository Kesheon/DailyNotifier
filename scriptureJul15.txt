Become imitators of me, just as I am of Christ.

How grateful we are to have so many sisters working hard in the congregation! They participate at the meetings and in the ministry. Some share in maintaining the Kingdom Hall, and they show personal interest in fellow worshippers. Of course, they face challenges. Some provide care for elderly parents. Others endure opposition from family members. And still others who are single parents work hard to provide for their children. Why focus on giving support to sisters? Because the world does not always treat women with the dignity that they deserve. In addition, the Bible encourages us to give them support. For instance, the apostle Paul alerted the congregation in Rome to welcome Phoebe and "give her whatever help she may need." (Rom. 16:1,Â 2) Paul came from a culture that treated women as being inferior. But as a Christian, he imitated Jesus and treated women with dignity and kindness. w20.09 20 P1-2
