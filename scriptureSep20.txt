They all abandoned him and fled.

How did Jesus treat his apostles when they were temporarily in a weakened condition? Shortly after his resurrection, Jesus told some of his followers: "Have no fear! Go, report to my brothers [that I was raised]." (Matt. 28:10a) Jesus did not give up on his apostles. Even though they had abandoned him, he still called them "my brothers." Like Jehovah, Jesus was merciful and forgiving. (2 Ki. 13:23) Likewise, we have deep concern for those who have stopped sharing in the ministry. They are our brothers and sisters, and we love them! We still remember the labors of love that those fellow believers performed in the past​—some perhaps for decades. (Heb. 6:10) We truly miss them! (Luke 15:4-7) So encourage inactive ones to attend the congregation meetings. And when an inactive one arrives at the Kingdom Hall, we should take the initiative by warmly welcoming him. w20.11 6 P14-17
