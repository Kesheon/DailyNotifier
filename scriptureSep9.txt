Let us not become egotistical, stirring up competition with one another, envying one another.

Social media can be used for a good purpose​—for example, to keep in touch with family and friends. Have you observed, though, that some of the material that people post on social media is designed to promote the people themselves? "Look at me" seems to be the message they want to convey. Some even post rude and obscene comments on their own photos or about the photos that others post. This too is contrary to the humility and fellow feeling that Christians are encouraged to cultivate. (1 Pet. 3:8) If you use social media, ask yourself: 'Might the comments, photos, or videos that I post give others the impression that I am bragging? Could I make others feel jealous?' Christians do not feel the need for promoting themselves. They follow the Bible's admonition found in today's text. Humility will help us avoid getting caught up in the world's spirit of self-promotion.​—1 John 2:16. w20.07 6 P14-15
