You know what sort of men we became among you for your sakes.

A student needs to see your enthusiasm and to hear your conviction about the truths that are found in the Bible. Then he will be more likely to get excited about what he is learning. If appropriate, tell him how living by Bible principles has helped you personally. Then he will come to realize that the Bible contains practical guidance that can benefit him too. During the Bible study, tell your student about real-life examples of those who faced challenges similar to his and overcame them. You could bring along on the study someone from the congregation whose example might benefit the student. Help your student to see how wise it is to apply Bible principles in his life. If the student is married, is the spouse also studying? If not, invite the mate to join in the study. Encourage your student to share what he is learning with his family and friends.​—John 1:40-45. w20.10 16 P7-9
