If you become discouraged in times of trouble, your strength will be meager.

We can become discouraged by many things​—some internal, some external. The causes may include imperfections, weaknesses, and ill health. They may also include our not receiving a desired assignment in Jehovah's service or our having to witness in a territory that seems unresponsive. It would be easy for us to develop an unbalanced view of our imperfections and weaknesses. As a result, we might believe that because of our failings, Jehovah would never welcome us into his new world. Such an attitude can be harmful. The Bible reveals that, with the exception of Jesus Christ, all humans "have sinned." (Rom. 3:23) But the Bible's Author is not a faultfinder or perfectionist. Rather, he is a loving Father who wants to help us. He is also patient. He sees how we struggle to fight our weaknesses and overcome an unbalanced view of ourselves, and he is ready to help us.​—Rom. 7:18, 19. w20.12 22 P1-3
