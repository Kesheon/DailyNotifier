He continued subject to them.

Early in his human life, Jesus chose to be submissive to his parents. He never rejected his parents' direction, reasoning that he knew more than they did. Jesus no doubt took his responsibility as the oldest son seriously. He surely worked hard to learn a trade from his adoptive father so that he could help support his family. Jesus' parents likely told him about his miraculous birth and what God's messengers had said about him. (Luke 2:8-19, 25-38) Jesus was not satisfied with what he was told; he also studied the Scriptures for himself. How do we know that Jesus was a good student of God's Word? Because while he was still a boy, the teachers in Jerusalem were "in constant amazement at his understanding and his answers." (Luke 2:46, 47) And at only 12 years of age, Jesus had already proved to himself that Jehovah was his Father.​—Luke 2:42, 43, 49. w20.10 29-30 P13-14
