Jehovah . . . takes note of the humble.

If we do not get a certain assignment, think of the example of the faithful angels. During King Ahab's reign, Jehovah invited the angels to suggest ways to fool the wicked king. A number of angels responded by offering ideas. But God chose one angel and told him that his suggestion would succeed. (1 Ki. 22:19-22) Did the other faithful angels become discouraged, perhaps thinking, 'Why did I bother?' We have no reason to believe that they did. The angels are truly humble and want all honor to go to Jehovah. (Judg. 13:16-18; Rev. 19:10) Fix in mind the privilege we have to bear God's name and to announce his Kingdom. Assignments are not what make us precious to God. It is when we are modest and humble that we become truly lovable to Jehovah and to our brothers. So beg Jehovah to help you remain modest and humble. Reflect on the many fine examples of modesty and humility that are recorded in his Word. Willingly serve your brothers in any way you can.​—1 Pet. 5:5. w20.12 26 P16-17
