[Christ] loved me and handed himself over for me.

We may wonder, 'How can I know for sure that Jehovah has not given up on me?' In a sense, by asking that question, we also answer it. Decades ago, The Watchtower stated: "We [may] find ourselves stumbling and falling many times over some bad habit that has bitten more deeply into our former pattern of life than we had realized. . . . Do not conclude you have committed the unforgivable sin. That is just how Satan would like you to reason. The fact that you feel grieved and vexed with yourself is proof in itself that you have not gone too far. Never weary of turning humbly and earnestly to God, seeking his forgiveness and cleansing and help." Before becoming a Christian, the apostle Paul committed a number of serious sins. Paul remembered what he had done. (1 Tim. 1:12-15) But he viewed the ransom as a personal gift to him. Paul thus avoided the trap of excessive guilt and focused on giving Jehovah his best from that point forward. w2
