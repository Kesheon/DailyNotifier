You husbands, . . . continue dwelling with them according to knowledge. Assign them honor as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one.

A family head can show humility in many ways. For example, he does not expect perfection from his wife and children. He listens to and considers the opinions of family members, even when they do not agree with his. In addition, a humble husband is willing to do household tasks, even if in his community these tasks are viewed as women’s work. That can be a challenge. Why? "Where I come from," says a sister named Rachel, "if a husband helps his wife wash dishes or clean the home, his neighbors and relatives will question if he is a 'real man.' They will think that he cannot control his wife." If that attitude is common where you live, remember that Jesus washed the feet of his disciples, even though it was viewed as a slave's job. A good family head is concerned, not about making himself look good, but about making his wife and children feel good. w21.02
