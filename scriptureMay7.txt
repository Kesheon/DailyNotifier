We have the unseen treasure of "working together" with Jehovah and the heavenly part of his organization. (2 Cor. 6:1) We do so whenever we share in the disciple-making work. Paul said of himself and those who share in this work: "We are God's fellow workers." (1 Cor. 3:9) When we participate in the Christian ministry, we are also Jesus' fellow workers. Recall that after commanding his followers to "make disciples of people of all the nations," Jesus said: "I am with you." (Matt. 28:19, 20) And what about the angels? What a blessing it is to be directed by angels as we declare "everlasting good news . . . to those who dwell on the earth"! (Rev. 14:6) With such heavenly support, what is being accomplished?

Jesus explains that in today's text. w20.05 30 P14-15
