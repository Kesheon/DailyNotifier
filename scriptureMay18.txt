A king's heart is like streams of water in Jehovah's hand. He directs it wherever He pleases.

When it is in harmony with his purpose, Jehovah may use his powerful holy spirit to cause people in authority to do what he desires. Humans can dig a canal to divert the water of a stream in a direction that fits their plans. Similarly, Jehovah can use his spirit to divert the thoughts of rulers in a direction that is in harmony with his purpose. When that occurs, people in authority feel motivated to make decisions that benefit God's people. (Compare Ezra 7:21, 25, 26.) What can we do? We can pray "concerning kings and all those who are in positions of authority" when these individuals are called on to make decisions that affect our Christian life and ministry. (1 Tim. 2:1, 2, ftn.; Neh. 1:11) As the first-century Christians did, we too pray intensely to God for our brothers and sisters who are in prison.​—Acts 12:5; Heb. 13:3. w20.11 15 P13-14
