Prove yourself faithful even to death, and I will give you the crown of life.

We know that if our enemies kill us, Jehovah will restore us to life. We are convinced that nothing they do can sever our attachment to Jehovah. (Rom. 8:35-39) What remarkable wisdom Jehovah has shown by giving us the resurrection hope! By means of it, he disarms Satan of one of his most effective weapons and at the same time arms us with unbreakable courage. If enemies of Jehovah threaten you with death, will you be willing to entrust him with your life? How can you know? One way is to ask yourself, 'Do the small decisions I make each day give evidence that I trust in Jehovah?' (Luke 16:10) Another question could be, 'Does my lifestyle prove that I trust in Jehovah's promise to care for my material needs if I seek his Kingdom first?' (Matt. 6:31-33) If the answer to those questions is yes, you will be prepared for any trial that comes your way.​—Prov. 3:5, 6. w20.08 17-18 P15-16
