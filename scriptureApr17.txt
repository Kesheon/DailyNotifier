It is sown in corruption; it is raised up in incorruption.

The apostle Paul was referring to a person who is resurrected with a heavenly body, that is, "a spiritual one." (1 Cor. 15:43, 44) When Jesus walked the earth, he had a fleshly body. But when he was resurrected, he "became a life-giving spirit" and returned to heaven. Likewise, anointed Christians would be resurrected to spirit life. Paul explained: "Just as we have borne the image of the one made of dust, we will bear also the image of the heavenly one." (1 Cor. 15:45-49) Note that Jesus was not resurrected with a human body. Paul pointedly said: "Flesh and blood cannot inherit God's Kingdom" in heaven. (1 Cor. 15:50) The apostles and other anointed ones would not be resurrected to heaven with corruptible bodies of flesh and blood. w20.12 10-11 P10-12
