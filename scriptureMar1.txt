Happy are you whenever men hate you.

We do not choose to be hated. We are not trying to be martyrs. So why can we be happy when hated? Consider three reasons. First, when we endure, we gain God's approval. (1 Pet. 4:13, 14) Second, our faith is refined and becomes stronger. (1 Pet. 1:7) And third, we will receive a priceless reward​—everlasting life. (Rom. 2:6, 7) Soon after Jesus' resurrection, the apostles experienced the happiness he spoke about. After being flogged and ordered to stop preaching, they rejoiced. Why? "Because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of [Jesus'] name." (Acts 5:40-42) They loved their Master more than they feared the hatred of their enemies. And they showed their love by proclaiming the good news "without letup." Many of our brothers today continue to serve faithfully despite difficulties. They know that Jehovah will not forget their work and their love for his name. w21.03 25 P18-19
