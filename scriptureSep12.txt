The Son of man came to seek and to save what was lost.

How does Jehovah want us to feel about his lost sheep? Jesus provides the pattern for us. He knew that all of Jehovah's sheep are precious in God's eyes, so Jesus did all he could to help "the lost sheep of the house of Israel" return to Jehovah. (Matt. 15:24) As the fine shepherd, Jesus also did his utmost to avoid losing any of Jehovah's sheep. (John 6:39) The apostle Paul urged the elders of the congregation in Ephesus to imitate Jesus' example. "You must assist those who are weak and must keep in mind the words of the Lord Jesus, when he himself said: 'There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.'" (Acts 20:17,Â 35) Clearly, elders today have a special responsibility in this regard. "When I think of how much Jehovah cares for his lost sheep, I feel motivated to do all I can to help them," explains Salvador, an elder in Spain. "I am convinced that Jehovah wants me to care for them." w20.06 23 P15-16
