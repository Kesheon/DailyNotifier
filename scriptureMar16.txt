I saw . . . a great crowd, which no man was able to number.

A history-making talk entitled "The Great Multitude" was given in 1935 by J. F. Rutherford at a convention0 in Washington, D.C., U.S.A. In his talk, Brother Rutherford identified those who would make up the "great multitude:" (King James Version), or "great crowd," mentioned at Revelation 7:9. Until then, this group was thought to be a secondary heavenly class that was less faithful. Brother Rutherford used the Scriptures to explain that the great crowd are not chosen to live in heaven, but they are Christ’s other sheep who will survive "the great tribulation" and live forever on earth. (Rev. 7:14) Jesus promised: "I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those too I must bring in, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd." (John 10:16) These sheeplike ones are loyal Witnesses of Jehovah who have the prospect of living forever in Paradise on earth.​—Matt. 25:31-33, 46. w21.01 14 P1-2
