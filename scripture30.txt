Return evil for evil to no one.

Jesus told his followers to love their enemies. (Matt. 5:44, 45) Is that easy to do? By no means! But it is possible with the help of God's holy spirit. The fruitage of God's spirit includes love as well as patience, kindness, mildness, and self-control. (Gal. 5:22, 23) These qualities help us to endure hatred. Many opposers have had a change of heart because a believing husband, wife, child, or neighbor displayed those godly qualities. Many opposers have even become our dear brothers and sisters. So if you find it hard to love those who hate you just because you are serving Jehovah, pray for holy spirit. (Luke 11:13) And be fully convinced that God's way is always best. (Prov. 3:5-7) Hatred can be powerful and hurtful, but love is much stronger. It wins hearts. And it brings joy to Jehovah's heart. But even if opposers continue to hate us, we can still be happy. w21.03 23 P13; 24 P15, 17
