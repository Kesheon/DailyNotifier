Elders, you have the weighty responsibility of helping publishers to be effective in their ministry, including their Bible study work. If someone is shy about conducting a Bible study in your presence, offer to conduct the study. Elders can do a great deal to encourage and to motivate the teachers to persevere. (1 Thess. 5:11) Even if we do not presently conduct a Bible study, we can still help someone to grow spiritually. Without taking over, we can with our well-prepared comments support the teacher during a study session. We can befriend the students when they come to the Kingdom Hall, and we can serve as good examples for them. And elders can encourage the students by making time for them and the teachers by training and commending them. Really, what greater joy could we have than knowing that we played even a small part in helping someone come to love and serve our Father, Jehovah? w21.03 13 P18-19
