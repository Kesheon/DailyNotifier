Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching.

Parents, if your children are to be convinced that they have the truth, they need to have a personal relationship with God and to be convinced of the truthfulness of what the Bible teaches. If you are to teach your children the truth about God, you must set the example by being good students of the Bible. You must take time to meditate on what you learn. Then you will be able to teach your children to do the same. You need to teach your children to use our Bible study tools, just as you teach one of your Bible students. In doing so, you will help your children to appreciate Jehovah and the channel he uses to dispense spiritual food​—"the faithful and discreet slave." (Matt. 24:45-47) Do not settle for teaching your children only basic Bible truths. Help them develop strong faith by teaching them about "the deep things of God" to an extent that is appropriate to their age and ability.​—1 Cor. 2:10. w20.07 11 P10, 12-13
