I do all things for the sake of the good news, in order to share it with others.

What subjects might you discuss with a religious person? Try to find common ground. He may worship only one God, he may recognize Jesus as the Savior of humankind, or he may believe that we are living in a time of wickedness that will soon end. Based on beliefs you have in common, present the Bible's message in a way that is appealing to that person. Keep in mind that people may not believe everything that their religion teaches. So even after you discern a person's religion, try to find out what he personally believes. A missionary brother notes that some people say that they believe in the Trinity, but they may not actually believe that the Father, the Son, and the holy spirit are one God. "Knowing that makes it much easier to find common ground with the person," he says. So try to find out what people really believe. Then, like the apostle Paul, you can "become all things to people of all sorts."â€”1
