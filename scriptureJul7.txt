It is not a desirable thing to my Father who is in heaven for even one of these little ones to perish.

Jehovah does not forget those who once served him but who have temporarily stopped associating with his people; nor does he forget the work they did in his service. (Heb. 6:10) The prophet Isaiah recorded a beautiful illustration to show how Jehovah cares for his people. "Like a shepherd he will care for his flock," Isaiah wrote. "With his arm he will gather together the lambs, and in his bosom he will carry them." (Isa. 40:11) How does the Great Shepherd feel when one of his sheep strays from the flock? Jesus revealed Jehovah's feelings when he asked his disciples: "What do you think? If a man has 100 sheep and one of them strays, will he not leave the 99 on the mountains and set out on a search for the one that is straying? And if he finds it, I certainly tell you, he rejoices more over it than over the 99 that have not strayed."​—Matt. 18:12, 13. w20.06 19-20 P8-9
