Bear the weaknesses of those not strong.

Inactive ones need consistent support from us. Like the lost son in Jesus' illustration, they may be emotionally scarred. (Luke 15:17-24) And they are likely weak spiritually because of what they experienced in Satan's world. We need to help them rebuild their faith in Jehovah. In the illustration of the lost sheep, Jesus describes how the shepherd puts the sheep on his shoulders and carries it back to the flock. The shepherd has already spent time and energy finding the lost sheep. But he realizes that he will need to carry it back to the fold because it will not have the strength to return on its own. (Luke 15:4,Â 5) We may need to invest time and energy in helping some inactive ones to overcome their weaknesses. But with Jehovah's spirit, his Word, and the publications provided through the congregation, we can help them to become spiritually strong again. So if you are asked to study with an inactive person, why not welcome the privilege? w2
