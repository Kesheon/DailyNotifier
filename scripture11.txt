With you is the source of life.

There was a time when Jehovah was alone. But he was not lonely. He was complete in every way. Nevertheless, God wanted others to enjoy life. Motivated by love, Jehovah began creating. (1 John 4:19) First, Jehovah created a fellow worker. Then, by means of this first Son, "all other things were created," including millions of intelligent spirit creatures. (Col. 1:16) Jesus rejoiced at the opportunity to work with his Father. (Prov. 8:30) And the angelic sons of God also had reason to rejoice. They had front-row seats, as it were, when Jehovah and his Master Worker, Jesus, made the heavens and the earth. How did the angels respond? They "began shouting in applause" when the earth was formed, and they no doubt continued to applaud each of Jehovah's creative works, including his final masterpiece, humans. (Job 38:7; Prov. 8:31, ftn.) Each of these creations revealed Jehovah's love and wisdom.​—Ps. 104:24; Rom. 1:20. w20.08 14 P1-2
