Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you.

We often place our valuable things in the care of others. For instance, we may deposit our money in a bank. When we do, we expect that our funds will be kept secure and not be lost or stolen. The apostle Paul reminded Timothy that he had received something precious​—accurate knowledge of God's purpose for humankind. Timothy was also entrusted with the privilege to "preach the word" and to "do the work of an evangelizer." (2 Tim. 4:2, 5) Paul urged Timothy to guard what had been entrusted to him. Like Timothy, we have been entrusted with valuable things. Jehovah has favored us with an accurate knowledge of the precious truths found in his Word, the Bible. These truths are precious because they teach us how to have a good relationship with Jehovah and they explain what brings real happiness in life. When we accept those truths and live by them, we are freed from enslavement to false teachings and immoral practices.​—1 Cor. 6:9-11. w20.09 26 P1-3
