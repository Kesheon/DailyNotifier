Guard what has been entrusted to you.

We cannot afford to become distracted by a desire for more material things. "The deceptive power of riches" could choke our love for Jehovah, our appreciation for God's Word, and our desire to share it with others. (Matt. 13:22) If we are to safeguard the things that Jehovah has entrusted to us, we need to act quickly when we see danger. We can rehearse beforehand what we will do if we suddenly encounter an immoral scene, graphic violence, or apostate material while using the Internet or while watching a movie or TV program. If we prepare for what might happen, we can act quickly to escape spiritual harm and remain clean in Jehovah's eyes. (Ps. 101:3; 1 Tim. 4:12) We must guard the valuable things that Jehovah has given to us​—precious Bible truths and the privilege of teaching them to others. When we do, we will have a clean conscience, a life that has real meaning, and the joy of helping others come to know Jehovah. w20.09 30 P16-19
