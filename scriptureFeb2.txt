No one has love greater than this, that someone should surrender his life in behalf of his friends.

On the night before he died, Jesus reminded his disciples to love one another. He knew that self-sacrificing love would help them to stay united and to endure the world's hatred. Consider the example of the congregation in Thessalonica. From the time it was formed, its members were persecuted. Yet, the brothers and sisters there became examples of integrity and love. (1 Thess. 1:3, 6, 7) Paul encouraged them to continue showing love, even "in fuller measure." (1 Thess. 4:9, 10) Love would move them to console the depressed and support the weak. (1 Thess. 5:14) They followed Paul's instructions, for in his second letter, written about a year later, Paul could say to them: "The love of each and every one of you is increasing toward one another." (2 Thess. 1:3-5) Their love helped them to endure hardship and persecution. w21.03 22 P11
