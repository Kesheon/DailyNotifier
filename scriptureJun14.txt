Make it your aim . . . to mind your own business.

We do well to keep in mind that some single Christians have made it a personal goal to remain unmarried. Other single Christians would like to marry, but they simply have not found the right person. Still others may have lost their mate in death. In any case, should those in the congregation feel the need to ask single Christians why they are not married or to offer to help them find a mate? If help is not requested, how might such offers make our single brothers and sisters feel? (1 Tim. 5:13) Our single brothers and sisters will be grateful if we value them based on their fine qualities and not on their marital status. Instead of feeling sorry for them, we do well to appreciate their faithfulness. As a result, our single brothers and sisters will never feel that we are saying to them: "I do not need you." (1 Cor. 12:21) Instead, they will know that we respect them and value their place in the congregation. w20.08 29 P10, 14
