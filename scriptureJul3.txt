Throw all your anxiety on [God], because he cares for you.

Because of severe anxiety, some brothers and sisters feel very nervous and self-conscious in everyday social situations. They may find it difficult to be in large groups, but they continue to attend congregation meetings, assemblies, and conventions. They find it a challenge to speak to strangers, yet they talk to others in the field ministry. If that is true in your case, be assured that you are not alone. Many deal with similar struggles. Remember that Jehovah is pleased with your whole-souled efforts. The fact that you have not given up is proof that he is blessing you and giving you the strength you need. (Phil. 4:6, 7) If you are serving Jehovah despite enduring physical or emotional limitations, you can be confident that you are pleasing Jehovah. Many of us have physical limitations, yet we are enduring. (2 Cor. 4:16) With Jehovah's help, we will all run the race to the finish! w20.04 31 P20-21
