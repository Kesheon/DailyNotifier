[Wisdom] is more precious than corals; nothing you desire can compare to it.

One reason why the truths found in God's Word are precious is that Jehovah reveals them only to humble ones who are "rightly disposed." (Acts 13:48) Such individuals accept the channel he uses to dispense those truths today. (Matt. 11:25; 24:45) We cannot learn these truths on our own, and nothing else is anywhere near as valuable. (Prov. 3:13) Jehovah has also entrusted us with the privilege of teaching others the truth about him and his purposes. (Matt. 24:14) The message we bear is invaluable because it helps people become part of Jehovah's family and gives them the opportunity to gain everlasting life. (1 Tim. 4:16) Whether our personal share in the ministry is large or small, we are supporting the most important work being done at this time. (1 Tim. 2:3, 4) What an honor it is to be God's fellow workers!​—1 Cor. 3:9. w20.09 26-27 P4-5
