Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you meet with various trials.

Jesus promised his followers that they would be genuinely happy. He also warned those who love him that they would face trials. (Matt. 10:22, 23; Luke 6:20-23) We find joy in being disciples of Christ. But how do we feel about the possibility of being opposed by our family, persecuted by the government, or pressured to do what is wrong by our workmates or schoolmates? Understandably, such possibilities can make us feel anxious. People do not normally view persecution as a reason to feel joyful. Yet, that is exactly what God's Word tells us to do. For example, the disciple James wrote that instead of feeling overwhelmed, we should consider it a joy when we go through trials. (Jas. 1:2,Â 12) And Jesus said that we should be happy even when we are persecuted. (Matt. 5:11) Jehovah inspired James to write to Christians to give them practical advice that would help them remain joyful even when facing trials. w21.02 26 P1-2; 27 P5
