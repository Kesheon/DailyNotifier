You save those who are humble, but your eyes are against the haughty.

King David was a man who loved "the law of Jehovah." (Ps. 1:1-3) David knew that Jehovah saves those who are humble but opposes the haughty. So David allowed God's law to adjust his thinking. He wrote: "I will praise Jehovah, who has given me advice. Even during the night, my innermost thoughts correct me." (Ps. 16:7) If we are humble, we will allow God's Word to correct our wrong thinking before we act on those thoughts. God's Word will be like a voice that tells us: "This is the way. Walk in it." It will warn us when we are straying from the path​—to the left or to the right. (Isa. 30:21) By listening to Jehovah, we will benefit ourselves in a number of ways. (Isa. 48:17) For instance, we will avoid the embarrassment of having to be corrected by someone else. And we will draw closer to Jehovah because we recognize that he is treating us like a beloved child.​—Heb. 12:7. w20.11 20 P6-7
