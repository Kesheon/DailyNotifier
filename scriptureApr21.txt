If any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep asking God, for he gives generously to all and without reproaching, and it will be given him.

Satan presents us with many temptations to do wrong. How do we respond? It is easy to rationalize. For example, we might reason: 'Well, I would not be disfellowshipped for doing this, so it must not be that serious.' Such reasoning is deeply flawed. We do better to ask ourselves such questions as these: 'Is Satan trying to use this temptation to divide my heart? If I give in to wrong desires, would I bring reproach on Jehovah's name? Would this action draw me closer to my God, or might it distance me from him?' Meditate on such questions. Pray for wisdom to answer them honestly, without self-deception. Doing so can be a real protection. It can help you to reject temptation firmly, as Jesus did when he said: "Go away, Satan!" (Matt. 4:10) Remember, a divided heart is of little value. w20.06 12-13 P16-17
