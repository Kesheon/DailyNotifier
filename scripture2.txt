It was granted the locusts, not to kill them, but to torment them five months.

This prophecy describes a swarm of locusts that have human faces and 'what seem to be crowns of gold' on their heads. (Rev. 9:7) They torment "those people [God's enemies] who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads" for a period of five months, the average life span of a locust. (Rev. 9:4) This does indeed appear to be a description of Jehovah's anointed servants. They boldly proclaim God's judgments against this wicked system of things and, as a result, make its supporters very uncomfortable. Are we saying that the locusts described at Joel 2:7-9 are not the same as the locusts presented in the book of Revelation? Yes. In the Bible, it is not unusual for a symbol to convey different meanings in different settings. For example, at Revelation 5:5, Jesus is called "the Lion of the tribe of Judah," whereas at 1Â Peter 5:8, the Devil is described as "a roaring lion." w20.04 3 P8; 5 P10
