Step over into Macedonia and help us.

In recent years, many publishers have made it their goal to learn another language so that they can expand their ministry and serve in a congregation where there is a greater need for Kingdom publishers. This is a personal decision that these Christians make in order to advance Kingdom interests. Although it may take years for them to become fluent in the new language, they accomplish much good. Their fine qualities and experience strengthen and stabilize the congregation. We value these self-sacrificing brothers and sisters! A body of elders would not hold back from recommending a brother to serve as an elder or a ministerial servant simply because he is not yet fluent in the language of the congregation. The elders will evaluate a brother based on the Scriptural qualifications for elders and ministerial servants and not on how well he speaks the language of the local congregation.​—1 Tim. 3:1-10, 12, 13; Titus 1:5-9. w20.08 30 P15-16
