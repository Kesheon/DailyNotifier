Teach me your regulations.

A good student may learn about God's laws, even admire them. But will the student obey Jehovah out of love for him as a Person? Remember, Eve knew God's law, but she did not truly love the Lawgiver; nor did Adam. (Gen. 3:1-6) So we must do more than teach others about God's righteous requirements and standards. Jehovah's requirements and standards are appealing and beautiful. (Ps. 119:97, 111, 112) But our students may not see them that way unless they see Jehovah's love behind those laws. So we might ask our students: "Why do you think God asks his servants to do this or to refrain from doing this? What does that tell us about him as a Person?" If we help our students to think about Jehovah and to develop real love for his glorious name, we are more likely to reach their heart. Our students will come to love not only the laws but also the Lawgiver. They will grow in faith and will be helped to endure fiery tests to come.​—1 Cor. 3:12-15. w20.06 10 P10-11
