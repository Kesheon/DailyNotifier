Their armies gathered together to wage war against the one seated on the horse and against his army.

If we view the prophecies of Ezekiel 38:10-23; Daniel 2:43-45; 11:44–12:1; and Revelation 16:13-16, 21 as speaking about the same time period and events, it appears that we can expect the following developments. Sometime after the start of the great tribulation, "the kings of the entire inhabited earth" will form a coalition of nations. (Rev. 16:13, 14) That coalition becomes what the Scriptures call "Gog of the land of Magog." (Ezek. 38:2) That coalition of nations will make one final all-out assault on God's people. Speaking of this time, the apostle John saw a storm of unusually large hailstones raining down on God's enemies. That symbolic hailstorm may take the form of a hard-hitting judgment message delivered by Jehovah's people that provokes Gog of Magog into attacking God's people with the intention of wiping them off the earth.​—Rev. 16:21. w20.05 15 P13-14
