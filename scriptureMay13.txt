[Abraham] was awaiting the city having real foundations, whose designer and builder is God.

Abraham had such strong faith in God's promises that it was as if he could see the Anointed One, or Messiah, who would be King of God's Kingdom. For this reason, Jesus could tell the Jews in his day: "Abraham your father rejoiced greatly at the prospect of seeing my day, and he saw it and rejoiced." (John 8:56) Clearly, Abraham knew that his descendants would form a Kingdom that had Jehovah's backing, and he was willing to wait for Jehovah to fulfill that promise. How did Abraham show that he was waiting for the city, or Kingdom, designed by God? First, Abraham did not join himself to any earthly kingdom. He remained a nomad, choosing not to settle down and give his support to a human king. In addition, Abraham did not try to set up his own kingdom. Instead, he kept obeying Jehovah and waited for Him to fulfill His promise. In doing so, Abraham showed extraordinary faith in Jehovah. w20.08 3 P4
