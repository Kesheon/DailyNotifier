They will hunger no more.

Right now, some of Jehovah's people are suffering physical hunger because of oppressive economic conditions or as a result of the ravages of civil unrest and war. Others are imprisoned for their faith. However, those of the great crowd are thrilled to know that on escaping the destruction of this wicked system of things, they will always have an abundance of physical and spiritual food. When destruction is unleashed on Satan's system of things, the great crowd will be spared the "scorching heat" of Jehovah's anger that he will pour out on the nations. After the great tribulation ends, Jesus will guide these earthly survivors to the "waters of [everlasting] life." (Rev. 7:17) Just think: The great crowd have a unique prospect. Of all the billions who have ever lived, they may never die! (John 11:26) The other sheep have a marvelous hope for which they are thankful to Jehovah and Jesus! w21.01 16-17 P11-12
