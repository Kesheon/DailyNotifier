This tested quality of your faith produces endurance.

Trials can be likened to the fire that is used to forge a blade of steel. When the blade is heated and cooled, the steel becomes stronger. Similarly, when we endure trials, our faith is strengthened. That is why James wrote: "Let endurance complete its work, so that you may be complete and sound in all respects." (Jas. 1:4) When we see that our trials make our faith stronger, we can endure them with joy. In his letter, James also identifies some of the things that could cause us to lose our joy. One challenge is not knowing what to do. When undergoing a trial, we want to look to Jehovah for help to make choices that please him, benefit our brothers and sisters, and help us to keep our own integrity. (Jer. 10:23) We need wisdom to know what course to take and what we should say to those who oppose us. If we do not know what to do, we may feel that we are helpless victims of our circumstances, and we could quickly lose our joy. w21.02 28 P7-9
