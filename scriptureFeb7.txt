Unify my heart.

King David saw another man's wife bathing. He knew Jehovah’s standard: "You must not desire your fellow man's wife." (Ex. 20:17) Yet, evidently he kept looking. His heart became divided between his desire for the woman, Bath-sheba, and his desire to please Jehovah. Although David had long loved and feared Jehovah, he gave in to his selfish desire. In that instance, David pursued a very bad course. He brought reproach on Jehovah's name. David also brought terrible harm to innocent people, including his own family. (2 Sam. 11:1-5, 14-17; 12:7-12) Jehovah disciplined David, and he recovered. (2 Sam. 12:13; Ps. 51:2-4, 17) David remembered the trouble and misery that resulted when he let his heart become divided. His words recorded at Psalm 86:11 may also be rendered: "Give me an undivided heart." Did Jehovah help David make his heart whole, or undivided? Yes, for Jehovah's Word later refers to David as a man whose "heart was . . . complete with Jehovah his God."
