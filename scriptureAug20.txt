Make disciples . . . , teaching them.

What will greatly help Bible students to make spiritual progress? Attending our Christian meetings. The Scriptural instruction given at the meetings will deepen their knowledge, strengthen their faith, and help them to grow in their love for God. (Acts 15:30-32) Also, a publisher may tell the student how his own growing love for Jehovah moved him to obey God's commandments. (2 Cor. 7:1; Phil. 4:13) And when Bible students get to know a variety of faithful publishers, the students learn from their examples what it means to observe Christ's command to love God and neighbor. (John 13:35; 1 Tim. 4:12) They see that publishers deal with challenges that are similar to the ones they face and learn that the changes they need to make to become a disciple of Christ are within reach. (Deut. 30:11) Each one in the congregation can contribute in various ways to the spiritual progress of Bible students.​—Matt. 5:16. w20.11 5 P10-12
