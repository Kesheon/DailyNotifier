Your humility makes me great.

Can we really say that Jehovah is humble? Yes, we can, as David acknowledged above. (Ps. 18:35) Perhaps David was thinking of the day when the prophet Samuel came to the house of David's father to anoint the future king of Israel. David was the youngest of eight boys; yet, he was the one whom Jehovah chose to replace King Saul. (1 Sam. 16:1, 10-13) David would certainly agree with the sentiments expressed by a psalmist who said of Jehovah: "He stoops down to look on heaven and earth, raising the lowly from the dust. He lifts up the poor . . . to make him sit with nobles." (Ps. 113:6-8) Jehovah proves that he is humble by how he deals with imperfect human worshippers. Not only does he accept our worship but he also views us as his friends. (Ps. 25:14) In order to make friendship with him possible, Jehovah took the initiative by providing his Son as a sacrifice for our sins. What mercy​—what compassion—​he has shown us! w20.08 8 P1-3
