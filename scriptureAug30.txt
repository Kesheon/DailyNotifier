Finally, brothers, continue to rejoice, to be readjusted.

All of us are on a journey. Our destination, or goal, is to live in the new world under Jehovah's loving rulership. Each day, we try to follow the path that leads to life. But as Jesus said, that road is cramped and at times difficult to follow. (Matt. 7:13, 14) We are imperfect, and it is easy for us to stray from this path. (Gal. 6:1) If we are to stay on the cramped road to life, we must be willing to adjust our thinking, attitude, and actions. The apostle Paul encourages us "to be readjusted." When we try to examine our own thoughts and feelings, we face a challenge. Our heart is treacherous, and that can make it difficult for us to know where it might be leading us. (Jer. 17:9) It is easy to deceive ourselves with "false reasoning." (Jas. 1:22) So we must use God's Word to examine ourselves. God's Word reveals what we are on the inside, the innermost "thoughts and intentions" of our heart.​—Heb. 4:12, 13. w20.11 18 P1-3
