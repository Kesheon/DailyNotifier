I am sending you out as sheep among wolves.

When we start to preach and identify ourselves as Jehovah's Witnesses, we may face "storms" of family opposition, ridicule from acquaintances, and resistance to our message. How can you build your courage? First, be convinced that Jesus continues to direct this work from heaven. (John 16:33; Rev. 14:14-16) Next, strengthen your faith in Jehovah's promise to care for you. (Matt. 6:32-34) The stronger your faith becomes, the more courageous you will be. You showed great faith when you informed acquaintances and members of your family that you had begun to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses and to attend their meetings! No doubt you have made significant changes in your conduct and lifestyle in order to live by Jehovah's righteous standards. That too took faith and courage. As you continue to build courage, you can be confident that "Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go."—Josh. 1:7-9. w20.09 5 P11-12
