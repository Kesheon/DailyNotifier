My son Solomon [is] the one whom God has chosen.

Because of the limitations of age, health, or other factors, we may not be eligible to receive a certain theocratic assignment. In that connection, we can learn from the example of King David. When told that he had not been chosen to build God's temple​—something that David had dearly hoped to do—​he gave full support to the one whom God had selected for the assignment. David even contributed generously toward the project. What an outstanding example to follow! (2 Sam. 7:12, 13; 1 Chron. 29:3-5) Because of health problems, Hugues, a brother in France, stopped serving as an elder, and he could not even care for simple tasks around the home. He writes: "At first, I felt worthless and deeply discouraged. But in time, I saw the importance of accepting my limitations, and I found joy in serving Jehovah within those limits. Like Gideon and his three hundred men​—all of whom were tired—​I will keep up the fight!"​—Judg. 8:4. w20.12 25 P14-15
