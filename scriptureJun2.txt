All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth.

We must be friends with Jesus if we are to have a good relationship with Jehovah. Why is that true? Consider just two reasons. First, Jesus told his disciples: "The Father himself has affection for you, because you have had affection for me." (John 16:27) He also said: "No one comes to the Father except through me." (John 14:6) Trying to be Jehovah's friend without building a close bond with Jesus is like trying to enter a building without using the door. Jesus used a similar illustration when he described himself as "the door for the sheep." (John 10:7) A second reason is that Jesus perfectly reflected his Father's qualities. He said to his disciples: "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father also." (John 14:9) So an important way that we come to know Jehovah is by studying the life of Jesus. As we learn about Jesus, our affection for him will grow. And as our friendship with Jesus grows, our love for his Father will deepen. w20.04 21-22 P5-6
