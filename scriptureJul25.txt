Jonathan began to love him as himself.

Jonathan could have been jealous of David. As King Saul's son, Jonathan could have insisted that he was the rightful heir to the throne. (1 Sam. 20:31) But Jonathan was humble, and he was loyal to Jehovah. So he fully supported Jehovah's choice of David as future king. He was also loyal to David, even when this incurred the wrath of Saul. (1 Sam. 20:32-34) Jonathan had tender affection for David, so he did not view him as a rival. Jonathan was a skilled archer and a courageous warrior. He and his father, Saul, had a reputation for being "swifter than the eagles" and "mightier than the lions." (2 Sam. 1:22, 23) Therefore, Jonathan could have boasted about his own heroic exploits. However, Jonathan was not competitive or resentful. On the contrary, Jonathan admired David for his courage and reliance on Jehovah. In fact, it was after David killed Goliath that Jonathan began to love David as himself. w21.01 21 P6; 22 P8-9
