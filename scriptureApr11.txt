Keep doing this.

The vast majority who attend the Memorial have the earthly hope. Why, then, do they attend? For the same reason that people attend a friend's wedding. They want to show their love and support for the couple who are getting married. Thus, those of the other sheep attend the Memorial because they want to show their love and support for Christ and the anointed. The other sheep also attend to show their appreciation for the sacrifice that the Memorial commemorates, a sacrifice that makes it possible for them to live forever on earth. Another important reason why the other sheep attend the Memorial is in order to be obedient to Jesus' command. When Jesus instituted that special meal with his faithful apostles, he told them: "Keep doing this in remembrance of me." (1Â Cor. 11:23-26) So they continue to attend the Lord's Evening Meal as long as some anointed ones are alive here on earth. w21.01 17-18 P13-14
