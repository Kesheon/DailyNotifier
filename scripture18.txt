You must inculcate them in your sons.

Jesus' earthly parents helped Jesus to grow up to have God’s favor; they followed Jehovah's directions to parents. (Deut. 6:6, 7) Joseph and Mary had a deep love for Jehovah, and their priority was to encourage their children to develop that same kind of love. Joseph and Mary chose to maintain a good spiritual routine as a family. No doubt, they attended weekly meetings at the synagogue in Nazareth, as well as the annual Passover in Jerusalem. (Luke 2:41; 4:16) They may have used those family trips to Jerusalem to teach Jesus and his siblings about the history of Jehovah's people, possibly along the way visiting locations that are mentioned in the Scriptures. As their family grew in number, it must not have been easy for Joseph and Mary to keep a good spiritual routine. But look at the benefits they enjoyed! Because they put worship of Jehovah first, their family was well cared for spiritually. w20.10 28 P8-9
