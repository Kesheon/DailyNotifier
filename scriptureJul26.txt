The head of a woman is the man.

All Christians come under the perfect headship of Jesus Christ. However, when a Christian woman gets married, she comes under the headship of an imperfect man. That can present a challenge. So when considering a potential marriage mate, she would do well to ask herself: 'What indication do I have that this brother will be a good family head? Do spiritual activities play an important role in his life? If not, what makes me think that he will be a good spiritual head after we get married?' Of course, a sister also does well to ask herself: 'What qualities will I bring to the marriage? Am I patient and generous? Do I have a strong relationship with Jehovah?'(Eccl. 4:9,Â 12) The level of happiness a wife will experience in her marriage will depend to some extent on the decisions she makes before getting married. Millions of our Christian sisters set an excellent example in being submissive to their husband. They are to be commended! w21.02 8 P1-2
