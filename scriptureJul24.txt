I . . . was on the island called Patmos for speaking about God and bearing witness concerning Jesus.

Even while confined for preaching about Jesus, the apostle John proved that he was thinking of others. For example, he recorded the revelation that he received and had it sent to the congregations so that they would know what "must shortly take place." (Rev. 1:1) Then, likely after he was released from Patmos, John wrote his Gospel account of Jesus' life and ministry. He also wrote three letters in order to encourage and strengthen his brothers and sisters. You can imitate John's self-sacrificing life course and prove that you love people by what you choose to do with your life. Satan's system would have you spend all your time and energy on yourself, trying to make money or to make a name for yourself. Instead, self-sacrificing Kingdom proclaimers all over the world spend as much time as they can preaching the good news and helping people to draw close to Jehovah. w21.01 10 P9-10
